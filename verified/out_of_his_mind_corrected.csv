0,"Alamu now enjoys solitude, this solitude provides him the opportunity to send his mind on errands.","Àlàmú ti wá ń gbádùn àdáwà, dídáwà yìí ń fún un ní àǹfààní láti rán ọkàn rẹ̀ níṣẹ́."
1,"It gives him the chance to talk alone, and call on the invisible power from above to come down and solitude gives him the chance to laugh alone to himself.","Ó  ń fún un ní ààyè láti dá sọ̀rọ̀, kí ó sì pe àwọn ẹ̀mí àìrí látòkè wá pé kí wọ́n sọ̀kalẹ̀ wá láti wá yanjú àwọn ìṣòrò rẹ̀ fún un áti pàápàá jùlọ, ìdáwà yìí ń fún ní ààyè láti dá ẹ̀rín rín sí ara rẹ̀."
2,A big laugh for a big problem! – strange as that is.,Ẹ̀rín ńlá fún ìṣòro ńlá! Bí ó ti jẹ́ ìjọlójú.
3,"Whenever his wife disappeared into the corner of the street, in company of the house maid on her way to the market, and Alamu was left alone at home, he would quickly switch off the radio set to ensure perfect silence.","Nígbàkugbà tí ìyàwó rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú ọmọ ọ̀dọ̀ wọn bá ti pòórá sí kọ̀ọ̀rọ̀ òpópónà lọ́nà ọjà, tí ó sì ku Àlàmú nìkan sílẹ̀, kíá ni yóò pa ẹ̀rọ asọ̀rọ̀mágbèsì, kí gbogbo ilé lè dákẹ́ rọ́rọ́."

6,So – I`ll – I`ll survive.,"Fún ìdí èyí, màá – màá yè é."
7,All will be – will be well at last- at last - with me.,Ohun gbogbo á – ádára ní ìkẹyìn - ní ìkẹyìn - fún mi.
8,The time had also come for his mouth to open up for that strange uproarious laughter:,Àsìkò ti tó fún ẹnu rẹ̀ láti bẹ̀rẹ̀ ẹ̀rín aláruwo abàmì rẹ̀:
9,"`Ha ha ha ha – hum hum – ha ha ha ha… Yes, - ha ha ha ... Oh yes - hum hum - ha ha ha ha ...'","“Ha ha ha ha, hun hun—ha ha ha ha........bẹ́ẹ̀ ni ha ha ha ha ha.....bẹ́ẹ̀ ni o – hun hun ha ha ha ha”."
10,"Alamu`s curious laughter might last for about one minute at times, it would stretch for much longer, almost non-stop	! ","Ẹ̀rín abàmì Àlàmú yìí lè tó ìṣẹ́jú kan nígbà mìíràn, ó máa ńpẹ́ jù bẹ́ẹ̀ lọ, bí ẹni pé kò ní dáwọ́ èrín náà dúró mọ́! "
10,"He would open wide his mouth, like the tired hunter`s dog and laugh – laugh at himself, laugh at his predicament, and laugh at the wicked world which now lay in front of him as he peeped from the verandah of his three bedroom flat.", "Yóò la ẹnu rẹ̀ fẹ̀ bí i ti ajá ọde tí ó ti rẹ̀, á wá rẹ́rìn-ín, rẹ́rìn-ín rẹ̀, rẹ́rìn-ín ìṣòro rẹ̀, rẹ́rìn-ín ilé ayé burúkú tí ó dùbúlẹ̀ síwájú rẹ̀ bí ó ṣe ń yọjú láti ọdẹdẹ ilé oníyàrá mẹ́ta rẹ̀."
11,"He had started laughing that way again now, alone to himself, and his voice reechoed distracting the neighbours.","Ó tún bẹ̀rẹ̀ ẹ̀rín tí ó máa ń rín yẹn, sí ara rẹ̀, gbohùn-gbohùn ilé sì ń gba ohùn rẹ̀, ariwo rẹ̀ yìí sì ń da àwọn aládùúgbò wọn láàmú."
12,"The city sprawled out for miles around Alamu in a dusty mass of corrugated iron roofs - `broken china in the sun`, as the poet would say.",Ìlú náà tàn ká fún ọ̀pọ̀ máìlì yípo Àlàmú nínú ọ̀pọ̀ eruku tí ó jáde lára òrùlé tó ti dógùn-ún.

14,The ceaseless hooting of car horns came faintly to his ears.,Ariwo à-fọn-ọ̀n-fọn-tán àwọn ọkọ̀ ń dún létí rẹ̀ díẹ̀ díẹ̀.
15,"At some distance, hundreds of motor cars streamed out bumper to bumper in an endless queue on the narrow tarred street.","Láti ọ̀nà jíjin, ọgọọgọ́rùn-ún ọkọ̀ tò lọ rẹrẹ láìlópin ní títì ọlọ́dà tóóró."

17,"The city- hall building stood in all its splendor on the peak of the high Mapo Hill. At the far end of the town towards the horizon in the east, was the new Specialist Hospital building and a cluster of skyscrapers which gave lbadan a look of sophistication and modernity; never mind the great slum which marked out the indigenous areas of the city on the western side.","Gbọ̀ngán ìlú dá dúró nínú ọlá ńlá rẹ̀ ní té-ń-té òkè Màpó.

31,A one million naira national prize……..,"Mílíọ́ọ̀nù náírà kan, Àmì ẹ̀yẹ orílè-èdè."
32,"Alamu turned round, gazing at the animating scenery of the city.","Àlàmú yípo, ó ń wòye ìgbòkègbodò inú ìlú náà."
33,"It was not possible for anybody to conquer Africa`s largest city with such an absent-minded, bird`s-eye-view gaze.",Kò ṣeéṣe fún ẹnikẹ́ni láti ṣẹ́gun ìwòye ìlú tó tóbi jù níilẹ̀ aláwọ̀dúdú pẹ̀lú àìfọkànsí.
34,"Infact, the more you gazed that way, the less you saw of this sprawling city – city of chances; city of opportunities; city of problems.","Kódà, bí ó ṣe ń wò ó báyìí sí, ni díẹ̀ tí ó rí mọ nínú ìlú tí ó gbílè yìí, ìlú àǹfààní, ìlú wàhálà."
35,"It was some people`s luck in this city on seven hill, to make clean, steady money by dint of hard work and God`s abundant blessing.","Ó jẹ́ oríire fún àwọn ènìyàn kan nínú ìlú olókè méje yìí, láti pa owó mímọ́ láti ìgbà dé ìgbà nípasẹ̀ iṣẹ́ àṣekára pẹ̀lú ìbùkún yanturu láti ọ̀dọ̀ Ọlọ́run."
36,"Such people had good cars, owned self-contained bungalows in the outskirts of the city, through rather fast means.","Irú àwọn ènìyàn bẹ́ẹ̀ ní ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ tó dára, ilé àdágbé tiwọn ní ìgbèríko ìlú, lọ́nà to yára kíá kíá."

38,"And before you wake up to say, `good morning neighbor`, this set of people have become what the local musicians call, `currency controllers`, `delicate millionaires` `emergency directors` and `international managers`.","Kí ó sì tó di wí pé ó jí lówùúrọ̀ láti sọ“Ẹ káàárọ̀ ará ilé”, àwọn eni tí à ń wí yìí á ti dí nǹkan tí àwọn olórin ìbílẹ̀ wa ń pè ní “olùdarí owó”, “ẹni tó ń ṣàkóso owó ní mílíọ́ọ̀nù mílíọ́ọ̀nù”,“olùdarí òjijì”, “alákòóso okòòwò láàrin àwọn orílẹ̀-èdè”."
39,They become directors with no particular office address! Managers with no specific place of work!,Wọ́n ń di olùdarí láìsí àdírẹ́sì ọ́fíìsì kan pàtó. Olùṣàkóso láìní ibí-iṣẹ́ kan ní pàtó.
40,"But who, nonetheless, erect mansions in strategic places in town and ride.","Àwọn yìí náà ni wọ́n ń kọ́ ilé ńlá ńlá sí àwọn ibi pàtàkì nínú ìlú, tí wọ́n sì ń wá"
41,The most prestigious Mercedes-Benz cars – throwing their great bull_necks on the delicately soft backs seat of the air conditioned Mercedes with damsels of their daughters age group for company!,"Ọkọ̀ mẹ̀sí ọlọ́yẹ́ bọ̀gìnnì bọ̀gìnnì, wọ́n á wá ju ọrùn wọn kíki bí i ti abo màlúù sórí àga tìmùtìmù lẹ́yìn ọkọ̀ tí ọyẹ́ wà nínú rẹ̀ ní gidi, pẹ̀lú àwọn omidan tó tó ẹgbẹ́ ọmọ wọn fún fàájì."
42,"But inside this same city are the other forlon people who toil day in day out, with the determination to succeed and make a headway but whose labours end up in dismal failure.","Nínú ìlú yìí kan náà, ni àwọn akúṣẹ̀ẹ́ ènìyàn wà tí wọ́n ń tiraka lọ́sàn-án lóru, pẹ̀lú ìpinnu láti làlùyọ, kí wọ́n ṣaṣeyọrí, ṣùgbọ́n pàbọ́ ni gbogbo ìgbòkè-gbodò wọn ń já sí."
43,"These are the people with shattered dreams; people who hope all the time, against hope.","Èyí ni àwọn ènìyàn tí àlá wọn ò ṣe, àwọn ènìyàn tí wọ́n ní ìrètí ní gbogbo ìgbà, ìrètí tí kò níí ṣe."
44,Alamu inherited a sizeable proportion of the city’s problems – in spite of his education and position.,"Ìwọ̀n ńlá ni Àlàmú jogún nínú ìṣòro ìlú yìí, ládúrú ẹ̀kọ́ àti ipò rẹ̀."
45,"Those wonderful opportunities and chances offered by the city to the lucky dwellers had eluded people would say, and the many problems now confronting him seemed to have weighed him down body and soul."," Àwọn àǹfààní ààyè oríire tí ìlú ń fún àwọn olùgbé rẹ̀ ti fò ó dá.

46,"He reflected over the problems and laughed. No option. An echo – the talkative spirit of the air scattered his voice, making it fly, unchecked, in the wings of the wind.","Ó ro àwọn ìṣòro rẹ̀, ó sì rẹ́rìn-ín , kò sí ọ̀nà àbáyọ.

47,"When lifes’s problems come in mere trickles, you could cry.","Bí ìṣòro ayé bá ń wà ní díẹ̀díẹ̀, ó lè pa ènìyàn lẹ́kún."
48,"That would make sense but when the problems come tumbling down overwhelmingly, it is no use crying anymore; it is better to laugh, in the peoples’s own words, the matter would then have been ‘more serious than tears’!","Èyí ṣì ń mọ́gbọ́n dání ṣùgbọ́n tí ìṣòro bá ti ń gun orí ara wọn láìdáwọ́ dúró, ẹ̀rín ló dára jù láti rín, ní ti àwọn ènìyàn, “ọ̀rọ̀ náà ti ju igbe lọ!”"
49,That was why the ‘ha ha ha ha’ sound of Alamu’s grotesque laughter now reverberated… But evidently too loud now for his immediate neighbours’ comfort.,ìdí nìyí tí ariwo ẹ̀rín Àlàmú ‘ha ha ha ha’ fi ń pọ̀ sí i... Ṣùgbọ́n ó ti wá ń pọ̀jù fún ìtura àwọn ará àdúgbò rẹ̀.
50,"And so human heads started appearing in twos and threes – at the doorsteps, at the window panes, from behind the walls, and at the balconies of the surrounding houses.","Fún ìdí èyí, àwọn ènìyàn bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í narùn ní méjì-méjì, mẹ́ta-mẹ́ta láti ẹnu ọ̀nà, ojú fèrèsé, láti ẹ̀yìn ògiri àti lá́ti ẹ̀yìnkùlé àwọn ilé tó yí i ká."
51,"They held their chins looking curiously in the direction of Alamu’s flat, shaking their heads in pity.","Wọ́n ń fọ́wọ-lẹ́rán wo ògángán ilé Àlàmú, wọ́n sì ń mirí wọn tìkáàánú-tìkáàánú."
52,"‘Why? Why?’ they wondered, ‘Why should this happen to this man?’",“Èéṣe? Èéṣe? wọ́n ronú.......Èéṣe tí irú èyí fi ń ṣẹlẹ̀ sí arákùnrin yìí”.
53,‘Who brought this upon him?’,“Ta ló kó irú èyí bá a?”
54,"‘A rich young man with a big car, a man with plenty of money. A man with enough to eat and enough to drink. This world is not easy’.","“Ọ̀dọ́mọkùnrin tó ní ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ ńlá, tó ní ọ̀pọ̀lọpọ̀ owó. Ọkùnrin tó ń rí oúnjẹ àjẹyó jẹ, tí ó sì ń ní ohun mímu àmuṣẹ́kù.

55,But these people could only gaze and assess the situation of things from a distance.,Ṣùgbọ́n òkèèrè ni àwọn ènìyàn yìí ti ń wo bí nǹkan ṣe rí.
56,They had no direct access to Alamu’s house.,Wọn kò ní àǹfààní tààrà sí ilé Àlàmú.
57,"That was a house apart. With typical pseudo-aristocratic air, Alamu kept his neighbours at arm’s length. And, don’t blame him for that.","Ó jẹ́ ilé tí ó dá dúró lọ́tọ̀, Àlàmú kò fi ojú sílẹ̀ fún àwọn ará àdúgbò rẹ̀, pẹ̀lú ìgbé-ayé olówó ayédèrú tí ó ń gbé, kò fi ààyè ìgbanimọ́ra sílẹ̀ fún wọn rárá.

58,He was not in the same class with these people.,Kìí ṣe sàwáwù pẹ̀lú àwọn ènìyàn wọ̀nyí rárá.
59,"Socially and intellectually, he knew he was far ahead of them",Ní ti gbígbafẹ́ àti ọgbọ́n orí ni ó mọ̀ pé gbọ̀ọ̀rọ̀-gbọọrọ ni òun fi jù wọ́n lọ.

61,"Whereas his immediate neighbours were a pack of illiterates, knowing almost next to nothing, Alamu was a ‘book man’ who had spent the beteer part of his life in the country of the white man.","Kódà, àwọn ará àdúgbò rẹ̀ yìí jẹ́ aláìmọ̀-ọ́n-kọ, mọ̀-ọ́n-kà, a fẹ́rẹ̀ é lè sọ pẹ́ wọn kò mọ nǹkankan rárá.

64,"Whilst the neighbours had only wooden beds, raffia mats to sleep on, and the cheap transistor radio to listen to, Alamu owned three giant-sized vono beds, a cot for Tinu his young child, a colour television and a four-in-one stereo set from where music used to blare everyday, deafening the poor neighbours’ ears…","Bí ó tilẹ̀ jẹ́ pé bẹ́ẹ̀dì onígi àti ẹní pákítì láti sùn lé, àti rédíò olówó kékeré ni àwọn aládùúgbò rẹ̀ ní, bẹ́ẹ̀di onítìmù-tìmù“fónò” ńlá mẹ́ta àti ibùsùn Tinú, ẹ̀rọ amóhùn-máwòrán tí ó ń gbé àwòrán jáde àti ẹ̀rọ akọrin mẹ́rin-lọ́kan tí orin ti ń dún gbì-gbì-gbì lójoojúmọ́, tí ó sì ń dí àwọn tálákà àdúgbò létí ni Àlàmú ní."
65,testimony of his arrival in the world of affluence.,Ẹ̀̀rí dídé sí ìgbé ayé ọlọ́rọ̀.
66,"So, Alamu ought to be happy man. That was the general assessment of the people.","Fún ìdí èyí, aláyọ̀ ènìyàn ni ó yẹ kí Àlàmú jẹ́. Èrò gbogboògbò àwọn ènìyàn sí i rè é."
67,"But Alamu knew his own limitations, he knew he was far from  being happy, he alone knew where the shoes pinched, he would not talk to anyone about it, he kept his lip sealed.","Ṣùgbọ́n Àlàmú mọ ìwọ̀n ara rẹ̀, ó mọ̀ pé ìdùnnú jìnnà sí òun, òun nìkan ló sì mọ ibi tí bàtà ti ń ta á lẹ́sẹ̀, kò sì ba ẹnikẹ́ni sọ̀rọ̀ nípa rẹ̀, ófi ètè rẹ̀ métè."
68,"Whenever the neighbours greeted him in the morning, Alamu would wink, grin,nod- or just hiss at them.","Nígbàkugbà tí àwọn ará àdúgbò rẹ̀ bá ń kí i lówùúrọ̀, Àlàmú yóò fi ara dáhùn, bí i kó mi ẹnu, bíi kó ṣẹ́jú tàbí kí ó mirí, tàbí kí ó pòṣé ṣààrà sí wọn."
69,"Briskly he would hurry away on his toes, jump inside his peugoet car, back the car out of the garage, and race off – to God-knows where!","Kíá, ni yóò rìn kúrò, á fò sínú ọkọ pijó rẹ̀, á fi ẹ̀yìn ọkọ̀ jáde láti inú ọgbà ìgbọ́kọ̀sí rẹ̀, á ki erémọ́lẹ̀, sí ọ̀nà ibi tí ó jẹ́ pé ọlọ́run nìkan ló mọ̀!"
70,He got that car after his arrival in the country fromEngland three years ago – shortly after he took up the job of a senior Accountant with Bajoks Company Limited.,Ó ra ọkọ̀ náà lẹ́yìn tí ó ti ìlú Englandi dé sí ilé ní ọdún mẹ́ta sẹ́yìn - lẹ́yìn ìgbà díè tí ó di Aṣírò-ọrọ̀ àgbà ní iléeṣẹ́ Bajoks.
71,"A year later, he got married to Labake – the lady he met and fell in love with in England. Their wedding was lavish and expensive.","Lẹ́yìn ọdún kan ni ó fẹ́ Làbákẹ́, ọmọbìnnrin tí ó pàdé, tí ó sì nífẹ̀ẹ́ sí nílùú England.

72,"Immediately after his society wedding, Alamu started noticing a big hole inside his own pocket.","Kété, lẹ́yìn ìgbéyàwó alárinrin rẹ̀ yìí ni Àlàmú bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í ṣàkíyèsí ihò ńlá nínú àpò rẹ̀."
73,Money would not stay anymore! His pocket had started leaking!,Owó kò dúró níbẹ̀ mọ́! Àpò rẹ̀ ti ń jò!
74,"He would watch helplessly, his hard-earned money streaming away like a running water ofa river into the remote sea.","Á wá máa wò láìrí-ìrànlọ́wọ́, owó tí ó fara ṣiṣẹ́ kárakára fún wá ń ṣàn lọ bí i omi odò tí ó ń ṣàn lọ sí òkun."
75,"The financial commitments had become unbearably heavy, he didn’t envisage it would be as heavy as that – debts to the tune of thousands of naira.","Ètò ìnáwó rẹ̀ ti ń kọjá agbára rẹ̀, kò lérò pé ó lè pọ̀ tó ìyẹn - gbèsè ti ń di ẹgbẹẹgbẹ̀rún náírà."
76,"The expenses on his aged mother was one one big hole in the pocket. So also was the maintenance of his car, and the monthly allowance for their house maid.","Iye tó ń ná lórí ìyá rẹ̀ gan an ń kówó lọ, bẹ́ẹ̀náà ni ìtọ́jú ọkọ̀ rẹ̀ àti owó-oṣù ọmọ-ọ̀dọ̀ wọn."
77,"Not to talk of his regular bills: water rate, house rent, electricity bill, income tax, car loan, monthly deduction…","Kí á tó wá sọ owó-omi, owó-ilé, owó iná mọ̀nà-mọ́ná, owó-orí àti ìdápadà ẹ̀yáwó ọkọ̀ rẹ̀."
78,"Alamu’s pocket was seriously leaking, month-end, to him, was, consequently, a time to shed cold sweat, a time to frown and knit the eyebrow as he went through his list of expenditure.","Àpò Àlàmú ń jò gidigidi, ìparí oṣù sì ń jẹ́ àsìkò fún un láti làágùn tútù, ó jẹ́ àsìkò fún un láti lejú kí ó sì ranjú bí ó ṣe ń wo ètò ìṣúná owó rẹ̀ lésẹẹsẹ̀."
79,"After taking his salary, Alamu would drive his car life a jet bomber, race home in lightning celerity.","Lẹ́yìn tí ó bá ti gba owó oṣù rẹ̀, á wá wa ọkọ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ rẹ̀ bí i ọkọ̀ òfurufú elékùsọ́, á mú eré lọ ilé bí ẹ timọ̀."
80,"At home he would lock himself up inside the bedroom, pick up his diary and start reading out to himself the relevant comments he had scribbled inside it, from day one of the month, through to the last day.","Nílé, á ti ara rẹ̀mọ́ yàrá, á mú ìwé ìjẹ́rìí-ẹni rẹ̀, á wá bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í  ka àwọn ohun tó jẹ mọ́ ọn tí ó kọ sínú rẹ̀, láti ọjọ́ kìn-ín-ní oṣù títí di ọjọ́ tí ó kẹ́yìn."
81,"Every month was similar to the other, the situation was usually the same – with little or no modification.","Gbogbo oṣù ni ó máa ń jọ ara wọn, ohun tó ṣẹlẹ̀ nínú oṣù kọ̀ọ̀kan máa ń jọ ara wọn pẹ̀lú ìyàtọ̀ díẹ̀ tàbí làínì ìyàtọ̀ kankan."
82,"Today 10th July, landlord threatened to eject me, I owe him three months’ rent.","“Lónìí, ọjọ kẹwàá oṣù Agẹm̀ọ, onílé mi lérí láti lé mi jáde, mo jẹ ẹ́ ní owó-ilé oṣù mẹ́ta."
83,He swore oaths at me; called me all sorts of names.,"Ó ṣépè fún mi, ó pè mí ní orúkọ oríṣìíríṣìí."
84,"Boasted that he spent a great fortune to put up the buildings, that I should pay up or quit.","Ó fọ́nnu pé owó iyebíye ni òun fi kọ́ ilé òun, pé kí n san gbèsè mi  tàbí  kí n kó jáde”."
85,"Alamu looked up with a sorrow-laden eyes and mused to himself, ‘I must pay him up at the end of this month of July, no further scorn should poured on me for this’…","Àlàmú wòkè pẹ̀lú ojú tí ó kún fún ìbànújẹ́, ó dá sọ̀rọ̀ pé, “mo gbọ́dọ̀ san owó rè níparí oṣù Agẹmọyìí, ẹ̀gbín kankan ò tún gbọdọ̀ ta lé mi fún èyí”."
86,"Then, reading to himself from another page of the diary.",Lẹ́yìn náà  ni ó tún ṣí ojú ìwé mìíràn nínú ìwé ìjẹ́rìí-ẹni náà.
87,Labake embarrassed me today 21st July threatened to pack out. Quarrel over house keeping allowance. And little Tinu’s food stipend…My resolution?,"“Làbákẹ́ kàn mí lábùkù lónìí, ọjọ́ kọkànlélógún oṣù Agẹmọ, ó lérí láti kó jáde. Owó ìtọ́jú ilé ni ó fàjà.

88,"Three hundred naira to be set apart for this every month, beginning from this month of July.’",Àpò náírà kan-àbọ̀ ni n ó tún máa yà sọ́tọ̀ láti oṣù kéje yìínáà  lọ”
89,Enough!... Enough!... Alamu would shout to himself. He’d close up the accursed book and fling it furiously against the wall of his bedroom.,"Ó tó gẹ́!.......... ó tó gẹ́!.........Àlàmú  ké mọ́ ara rẹ̀, á pa ìwé òfònáà  dé, á sì jù ú mọ́ ògiri yàrá rẹ̀."
90,Enough! How was he going to survive it all without the assistance of the invisible power from above? Where was he going to get all the money from? Impossible!,Ó tó gẹ́!

91,"Yes, that was only the month of July. Month in month out, he got the wrong answers to all his additions.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, oṣù agẹmọ nìkan nìyẹn. Lóṣooṣù, kì í rí ìdáhùn tó tọ́ sí gbogbo ìṣirò rẹ̀."
92,His two plus two was five! Always five! The two plus two of a crazy mathematician!,Eéji pẹ̀lú Eéji máa ń fún un ní Aárùn-ún ní gbogbo ìgbà. Ìṣirò ayírí onímò ìṣirò.

94,"Before Alamu ever ever had the time to solve all these problems, another problems, another problem of greater magnitude would appear unto him.",Kí  Àlàmú tó ráyè láti yanjú àwọn ìṣòro wọ̀nyí ni àwọn mìíràn tí ó le ju èyí yóò tún dé bá a.
95,The monstrous posture of this new problem made all previous problems looks like a child’s play.,Ìrísí ìṣòro apanirun túntún yìí wá jẹ́ kí àwọn ìṣòro àtijọ́ dàbíi erémọdé lójú rẹ̀.
96,"This one pressed him hard to the wall, there was no place to run to anymore.","Eléyìí sún un kan ògiri, kò sí ibi tí ó fẹ́ sá sí mọ́."
97,"And now, he resolved; No more tears! no more tear drops!","Nísinsìnyí, ó tún èrò ara rẹ̀ pa; kò sí igbe mọ́! Kò sí omi ẹkún mọ́!"
98,"He was no longer going to sit down and cry like a child, he would keep his new problem to himself – face it squarely, grapple with it like a man, solve it like a man – with courage and will-power-all along laughing over it, no more tears.","Kò ní jókòó máa sunkún bí ọmọdé mọ́, ó máa gbé ìṣòro túntún rẹ̀ sínú - á kọjú mọ́ ọn, á gbá a mú bí i akọni, á yanjú rẹ̀ bí i ọkùnrin - pẹ̀lú ìgboyà àti ìfọkànsí bí ó ṣe ń lọ, á sì máa fi ọ̀rọ̀ òhún ṣẹ̀rín rín, kò sí omijé mọ́."
99,Alamu turned slowly away now from where he’d been standing gazing absent-mindedly at the city environment and yelling with laughter.,Àlàmú fi sùúrù yí padà kúrò níbí tí ó ti dúró wòye agbèègbè ìlúnáà láìfọkànsí pẹ̀lú ẹ̀rín lẹ́nu.
100,He’d caught sight of his wife from a distance returning from the market with Zenabu the house maid.,Ó ti rí ìyàwó rẹ̀ àti ọmọ-ọ̀dọ̀ wọn Sènábù láti ọ̀kánkán bí wọ́n ṣe ń bọ̀ láti ọjà.
101,"So, he had to withdraw. It is not good to allow Labake to get any hint.","Fún ìdí èyí, ó ní láti dáwọ́dúró, kò ní dáa láti jẹ́ kí Làbákẹ́ mọ nǹkankan rárá."
102,"As a woman, she possessed no strong shock absorbers to resist life’s tension and problems.","Gẹ́gẹ́ bí obìnrin, kò ní ọkàn láti kojú ìgbáyàsókè ayé àti ìṣòro."
103,Labake was sentimental and tender-hearted. She would break down in tears at the magnitude of this present problem. And that would not be good.,Làbákẹ́ kò ní ọkàn. Ó máa bú sẹ́kún ni bí ó bá rí bí ìṣòro tó bá wọn ṣe pọ̀ tó. Èyí kò sì ní daa.
104,"Alamu had promised his wife, right from the day of their wedding, that there would be no cause to make her regret or make her shed tears.","Àlàmú ti ṣe ìlérí fún ìyàwó rẹ̀, láti ọjọ́ ìgbéyàwó, pé kò ní sí ìdí fún un láti kábàámọ̀ tàbí kí ó sunkún."
105,"It was going to be sunshine and laughter all through. And if there were problems to grapple with, he’d told his wife he was up to the task. He would solve them like a man – a ‘true’ man.","Ó ní ìdùnnú ni yóò jẹ́ títí. Tíìṣòro bá sì wà láti kojú, yóò sọ fún ìyàwó rẹ̀ pé òun kájú òṣùnwọ̀n. Á yanjú rẹ̀ bí i ọkùnrin – ọkùnrin gidi."
106,"Alamu went back into the house with a disguised countenance, he picked up a magazine and started leafing through it while waiting for a knock on the door, let Labake come in, let her gaze and gaze, she would never make out anything.","Àlàmú ṣojú fúrúpadà wọ inú ilé, ó mú magasíìnì ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í ṣí i láwẹ́láwẹ́ bí ó ṣe ń dúró de ilẹ̀kùn kíkàn, kí Làbáké wọlé, kí ó wò wò, kò lèè rí nǹkankan mújáde."
107,"With Alamu’s head bent over the magazine, those red eyeballs of his would be concealed; those lines of depression and torture across his contenance would never be revealed.","Bí Àlàmú  ṣe doríkọlẹ̀ kọjú mọ́ magasíìnì, ojú rẹ̀ pípọ́n kò níí hàn; àmì ìrẹ̀wẹ̀sì àti ìjìyà kò níí farahàn."
108,One thing he would avoid was lapsing into that strange loud laugh.,Ohun kan tí ó yẹra fún ni ẹ̀rín aláriwo abàmì rẹ̀.
109,"It might raise Labeke’s suspicion, he would try to be as natural as possible, he would give Labake the normal welcome greetings – but still with his head bent over the magazine in pretence of absolute concentration.","Ó lè mú Làbáké fura, á gbìyànjú láti ṣe bí ó ti yẹ, yóò kí Làbákẹ̀ bí ó ti yẹ - ṣùgbọ́n kò ní í gbé orí sókè kúrò lára ìwé àtìgbàdégbà tí ó ń kà."
110,"Labake entered the house at last, and immediately went into the kitchen to start the business of cooking, she seemed to be in some hurry and had no time for the drooping figure at the corner of the sitting room.","Nígbẹ̀yìn gbẹ́yín, Làbákẹ́ wọlé ó sì wọ inú ilé ìdáná lẹ́sẹ̀kẹsẹ̀ láti bẹ̀rẹ̀ iná dídá, ó jọ wí pé ó ń kánjú, kò sì ráyè ẹni tó kájo sí kọ̀rọ̀ yàrá ìgbafẹ́."
111,"Obviously, she did not want the supper to be late since they did not have a good meal for lunch in the afternoon.","Ó hàn gedengbe pé, kò fẹ́ kí oúnjẹ alẹ́ pẹ́ nítorí pé wọn kò je oúnjẹ gidi kan lọ́sàn-án."
112,"Very soon, Alamu heard her shouting instructions to Zenabu.","Láìpẹ́, Àlàmú  ń gbọ́ igbe àṣẹ tí ó ń pa fún Sènábù."
113,"The loud clang of cups and spoons, and the resonant, metallic sound of the  aluminium plates reached his ears also- and he heaved a sigh of relief.",Ariwo ṣíbí àti ife pẹ̀lú abọ́ ayọ́ alumí ń dé etí rẹ̀ náà - ó túra ká.
114,What meal was Labake going to prepare for the evening? A meal that would fit the mood of time no doubt.,Oúnjẹ wo ni Làbákẹ́ máa sè fún alẹ́? Oúnjẹ tó bá àsìkò náà mu ni láìsí àní-àní.
115,"Meal of a hard time. Perhaps eko with vegetables and the cheap frozen fish… Or it could be ordinary boiled plantain sprinkled with salt, pepper and red palm-oil…","Oúnjẹ ìgbà ọwọ́n. Bóyá ẹ̀kọ pẹ̀lú ẹ̀fọ́ àti ẹja òkú-èkó pọ́ọ́kú tútù... tàbí kí ó jẹ́ ọ̀gẹ̀dẹ̀ bíbọ̀ tí wọ́n wọ́n iyọ̀, ata àti epo sí."
116,"Well.. No complaint. Just something, anything – to keep body and soul together.","Kò sí àwáwí, ká ṣá ti rí nǹkan láti so ọkàn àti ara pọ̀."
117,With the hope that all would be well before Labake would be completely fed up with the situation at home and start noticing the change in the order of things.,"Pẹ̀lú ìrètí pé ohun gbogbo á dára kí ó tó bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í sú Làbákẹ́, kó sì tó bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í ṣàkíyèsí àyípadà gbogbo nǹkan."
118,"The task before Alamu, therefore, was that of finding a quick solution.",Iṣẹ́ tó wà níwájú Àlàmú  báyìí ni wíwá ojútùú kíákíá sí ìṣòro wọn.
119,"All through the night, he kept awake – ruminating, these were serious problems.","Ní gbogbo òru, oorun kò kun ojú rẹ̀ –ó ń ṣe àṣàrò, àwọn ìṣòro yìí le gan-an."
120,Especially that latest one… It would be good if he could solve the problem quickly.,Pàápàá jùlọ èyí tó kẹ́yìn... yóò sì dára tí ó bá lè yanjú ìṣòro náà  ní kíá.
121,After solving it he would proudly call his wife and announce to her.,"Lẹ́yìn wíwá ojútùú síi, á wá pe ìyàwó rẹ̀ jókòó pẹ̀lú ìgbéraga láti kéde sí i."
122,"‘Sit down here and listen to me Labake, you didn’t know, but there had been problems,  I kept the problems away because I know your nature very well.","“Jókòó síbí kí o tẹ́tí sí mi Làbákẹ́, ìṣòro ti ń wà ṣùgbọ́n o ò mọ̀, mo fi ọ̀rọ̀náà  pamọ́ fún ọ nítorí pé mo mọ irú ènìyàn tí o jẹ́."
123,"You’ll cry, cry and cry… Feel badly depressed, so I kept it away, but don’t worry Labake, the problem has been solved…","Wà á sunkún sunkún sunkún, inú rẹ kò ní ídùn, ìrẹ̀wẹ̀sì yóò sì dé bá ọ, ìdí nìyí ti mo fi kó wọn pamọ́ fún ọ, ṣùgbọ́n Làbákẹ́, má bẹ̀rù, ìṣòro náà  ti kásẹ̀ ńlẹ̀."
124,Praise God!’,Yin Olúwa lógo!
125,"Meanwhile, he would continue to play the man.",Yóò sì tẹ̀síwájú láti máa ṣe bí ọkùnrin.
126,"Nevermore would he wear his sorrow and muse, so now, Alamu shrugged, parted his lips and opened wide his mouth… Then –","Kò sì ní gbé ìbànújẹ́ tàbí  àṣàrò rẹ̀ sójú. Nísinsìnyí, Àlàmú gún èjìká rẹ̀, ó ya ẹnu rẹ̀ gbàgà………lẹ́yìn náà -"
127,"‘Ha ha ha ha – hum hum – Ha ha ha ha… Yea – ha ha ha ha. Yes, yes – hum hum – ha ha ha ha!’","Ha ha ha ha……hun hun……ha ha ha ha……….Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni…………ha ha ha ha, bẹ́ẹ̀ni, bẹ́ẹ̀ ni……hun hun……..ha ha ha ha!"
128,"That uproarious laughter again! He laughed it loud and long… And its noise could have woken Labake up in her own room, had she not been fast asleep.","Ẹ̀rín aláruwo yẹn tún ni! Ó rẹ́rìn-ín náà gùn. Ariwo rẹ̀ ò bá ti jí Làbákẹ́ dìde nínú yàrá rẹ̀, bí kò bá ṣe pé óti sùn fọnfọn."
129,How practicable was it going to be. keeping Labake out of the whole situation?,"Báwo ni yóò ṣe ṣe é ṣe, láti máa fi gbogbo ọ̀rọ̀ yìí pamọ́ fún Làbákẹ́?"
130,For how long was he going to contain the situation all alone?,Ìgbà wo ni yóò ṣe gbogbo èyí dà?
131,These were the questions Alamu asked himself again and again.,Èyí ni àwọn ìbéèrè tí Àlàmú ń bí ara rẹ̀ ní àbítúnbí.
132,"And the answer that came each time was ‘not practicable’… ‘not possible’… Were they not husband and wife, living under the same roof, sharing the same flat?",Àwọn ìdáhùn tó ń tẹ̀lé e ni…….”kò ṣe é ṣe”……..“kò ṣe é ṣe”…………ṣé kì í ṣe ọkọ àti ìyàwó tí ó ń gbé abẹ́ òrùlé kan náà̀ ni wọ́n?
133,"The more he struggled to hide, the more he revealed himself.","Bí ó ṣe ń tiraka láti fi pamọ́ tó, bẹ́ẹ̀ náà ni ó ń fi ara rẹ̀ hàn tó."
134,Still he continued to try. No sin in trying really.,"Síbẹ̀ síbẹ̀, ó tẹ̀síwájú láti gbìyànjú, kò sí ẹ̀ṣẹ̀ nínú ìgbìyànjú rárá."
135,"Inside his room, he would bury his head under the pillow and talk in whispers to himself.","Nínú yàrá rẹ̀, yóò ti orí ara rẹ̀ bọ abẹ́ ìrọ̀rí rẹ̀, á sì máa sọ̀rọ̀ kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́ sí ara rẹ̀."
136,"He would cover his mouth with his handkerchief and reduce his irresistible laughter to a ‘whooping cough’,at the sudden realization that Labake was around!","Áwá bo ẹnu rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú aṣọ ìnujú, á wá sọ ẹ̀rín àsàsàmò sì rẹ̀ di ikó nígbà tó bá déédé mọ̀ pé Làbákẹ́ ti wà nítòsí!"
137,It was all like the story of the proverbial man who decided to bury himself alive to hide away from people. The mythological man tried it…,Ó ti wá dàbíi ìtàndòwe nípa Ọkùnrin kan tó pinnu láti sin ara rẹ̀ láàyè láti farapamọ́ fún àwọn ènìyàn.

138,"And at the end of the exercise, they found out one of his hands was outside the grave, he discovered and pulled out of his grave!","Ní òpin gbogbo rẹ̀, óṣà kíyèsí pé ọwọ́ rẹ̀ kán wà ní ìta, wọ́n ríi, wọ́n sì wọ́ ọ kúrò nínú sàréè rẹ̀."
139,"Against Alamu’s wish, he found he was putting Labake in the full picture of things – directly or indirectly.","Tako ìfé-inú Àlàmú, ó rí i pé òun ti ń fi àwòrán nǹkan hàn Làbákẹ́ lọ́nà tààrà àti ẹ̀bùrú."
140,"Everything gave him away – his general behavior towards Labake, his daily conversation with her.","Gbogbo re ló ń fi íhàn - gbogbo Ìhùwàsí rẹ̀ sí Làbákẹ́, gbogbo ìbára-ẹni-sọ̀rọ̀ ojoojúmọ́ wọ̣n."
141,‘Did you not see the landlord yesterday Alamu?’,"“Àlàmú, ṣé o rí onílé wa lanáà ?”"
142,‘Landlord? Where Labake?’,"“Onílé?, níbo Làbákẹ́”"
143,"‘Stop teasing Alamu. All along, I knew you saw him.You were mere dodging.","“Yé é mú mi ṣeré Àlàmú. Bí ó ṣe ń lọ, mo mọ̀ pé o rí i. O kàn ń sá pamọ́ ni."
144,Your legs showed behind the toilet door where you were hiding.,Ẹsẹ̀ rẹ ń hàn lábẹ́ ilẹ̀kùn ilé-ìtọ̀ níbití o ti ń sá pamọ́.
145,But lucky you. ‘The landlord did not look down’,"Ṣùgbọ́n Ọlọ́run yọ ẹ́, onílé kò wolẹ̀."
146,He fixed his gaze up on the ceiling. ‘Didn’t you say you paid him all his money?’,Ó tẹjú mọ́ òkè àjà. ṣe bí o ní o ti san gbogbo owó rẹ̀fún un?
147,‘Well… yea… yea’,"“Ẹẹẹẹẹnnnn…..Bẹ́ẹ̀ , Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni”"
148,‘Well yea yea? Why was the man looking so displeased and so angry?,"“Ẹẹẹẹẹnnnn…..Bẹ́ẹ̀ , Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni? Kílódé tí ojú Ọkùnrin náà ṣe le koko tí ó sì ń tọ́ka àìnínú dídùn sí wa?”"
149,He said you should come and see him immediately. I forgot to mention that to you.’,“Ó ní kí o wá rí òun lẹ́sẹ̀kẹsẹ̀. Mo gbàgbé láti sọfún ẹ”
150,"‘Hum, hum, Immediately? Hum, hum. I see.’","“Hùn, hùn ún, lẹ́sẹ̀kẹsẹ̀? Hùn hùn, mo rí i bẹ́ẹ̀.”"
151,Alamu’s heart missed a beat.,Àyà Àlàmú já. 
152,But he quickly readjusted – laughing it over – playing the man!,ṣùgbọ́n ó tètètúnraṣe – ó rín ẹ̀rín sí i – ó ń fi Ọkùnrinn náà  ṣeré. 
153,"‘How did you pay him, Alamu? By cash?’","“Báwo ni o ṣe sanwófún un, ṣé kìṣì?” "
154,‘Yes – yea – ah – ah!’,“Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni…..Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni…..ah  ah” 
155,"‘Yes, yea-ah-ah? Which one now?’",“Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni…ah? Èwo níbẹ̀?”
156,Alamu laughed again.,Àlàmú túnrẹ́rìn-ín.
157,"Labake fished out from her small handbag a piece of paper, and handed it over to her husband.","Làbákẹ́ yọ ìwé pélébé kan jad́e nínú báàgì ìfàlọ́wọ́ rẹ̀, ó sì mú un fún ọkọ rẹ̀."
158,‘See this. The cheque you issued to me for the house-keeping allowance’.,“Wo èyí. Sọ̀wédowó tí o fún mi fún owó ìtọ́jú ilé.”
159,‘Why give me Labake? Present it to… to.. to the bank.’,"“Kílódé tí ò ń mú un fún mi  Làbákẹ́, mú un lọ……..lọ sí ilé ifowópamọ́sí.”"
160,‘It has been presented… But now returned. It bounced.’,“Mo ti mú un lọ... ṣùgbọ́n ó ta padà. Kò sówó níbẹ̀”
161,"‘Bounced?’ Alamu asked slowly. He took the cheque from Labake muttering, ‘I’ll see what else can be done’.","“Ta padà kẹ̀?”,  Àlàmú fi sùúrù béèrè. Ó gba sọ̀wédowó náà lọ́wọ́ rẹ̀, ó ń kálòlò……..“mà á wá…….wánǹkan ṣe sí i. "
162,Alamu’s landlord’s cheque had bounced three times!,Sọ̀wédowó tí Àlàmú fún onílé ti ta padà lẹ́èmẹ́ta!
163,Labake did not know. He did not tell her. He continued with his laughter.,Làbákẹ́ kò mọ̀. Kò sọfún un. Ó tẹ̀síwájú pẹ̀lú ẹ̀rín rẹ̀.
164,"During his course of his conversation with Labake, Alamu had laughed nervously more than five times.","Láàárín ìbára-ẹni-sọ̀rọ̀ rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú Làbákẹ́,  Àlàmú ti rín ẹ̀rín àjèjì rẹ̀ ju ìgbà márùn-ún lọ."
165,And he’d noticed how Labake looked uncomfortable at him.,Ó sì ti ń ṣàkíyèsí bí Làbákẹ́ ṣe ń wò ó pẹ̀lú àìbalẹ̀ ọkàn.
166,"For how long, really, was he going to succeed in Keeping Labake out of the whole situation?","Lóòótọ́, títí ìgbà wo ni yóò fi nǹkan pamọ́ fún Làbákẹ́ dà?"
167,"The answer came, once more with a note of finality: not for a month more brother!... not even for a week more!...","Èsì dé, lẹ́ẹ̀kan síi lọ́gán “Kì í ṣe fún oṣù kan mọ́ brọ̀dá!........kì í ṣe fún ọ̀sẹ̀ kan pàápàá!...”."
168,"There is a thing – an irresistible force – urging him on. Impelling him to loose control over his own action, and pushing him headlong into desperation. Inevitably.","Ohun kan wà tí ó ń tìí, kò jẹ́ kí ó ká páìṣe rẹ̀, ó ń sọ ọ́ di ọ̀dájú láìsí àní-àní."
169,"That was why, a few days later, Alamu found himself breaking new ground…","Ìdí nìyí tó jẹ́ pé lẹ́yìn ọjọ́ mélòó kan, Àlàmú rí ara rẹ̀ tó ń dá àrà túntún..."
170,He held a mug firmly wth his two hands – because it appeared to him that  the gentle ripples of the liquid content were soon going to shake the mug off his hands!,"Ó gbé ife ọtí si ẹnu rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú ẹ̀gbọ̀n rìrì, ó gbá ife ọtínáà mú gírígírí pẹ̀lú ọwọ́ rẹ̀ méjèèjì, nítorí ó jọ wí pé gáà sìinú ọtí náà fẹ́ gbọ̀n ife náà  kúrò ní ọwọ́ rẹ̀!"
171,The ripples inside looked to him like the gathering storm inside the deep ocean! A storm inside the mug.,Àwọn gáàsì yìí jọ ìjìinú òkun lójú rẹ̀! Ìjìinú ife! 
172,"The storm of a sticky, coloured liquid! And- Oh God! – all these would soon disappear inside his tummy! He shook his head pathetically.",Ìjì ọtíaláwò ọ̀tọ̀ kíkí! Àti pé – Olúwa ò!- gbogbo èyí ni yóò pòórá sínú ikùn rẹ̀! Ómirí rẹ̀ tàánú tàánú.
173,"The strange odour of the beer pierced his nostrils, as he gulped the content down the throat, his eyeballs twinkled excitedly.","Òórùn abàmì ọtí náàdá imú rẹ̀ lu, bí ó ṣe ń gbé e mì, ẹyin ojú rẹ̀ ń mì wóró-wóró tayọ̀ tayọ̀."
174,His first taste of beer! And what a taste! the bad taste of animal urine in the herbalist concoction!,Bíà àkọ́kọ́ tọ́wò rẹ̀! ìtọ́wò rè é bí i ìtọ́wo ìtọ̀ ẹranko burúkú nínú àsèjẹ bàbáláwo.
175,Alamu struggled not to allow the liquid content to come back into his mouth in vomit.,Àlàmú tiraka láti má jẹ́ kí ohun ṣíṣàn náà padà wá sí ẹnu rẹ̀ gẹ́gẹ́ bí èébì.
176,He forced it down down the tummy. The worms were no doubt happy inside the bowel and heard the faint chorus of some riotous revel…,"Ó fi tipá tipá tì í wọ ìsàlẹ̀ ikùn rẹ̀. Láìsí àní-àní, inú àwọn aràn inú rẹ̀ dùn nínú lọ́hùn-ún..."
177,Perspiration gathered over his brow. His eyes started seeing double.,Òógùn ṣarajọ sí ìpọ̀nrí rẹ̀. Ojúrẹ̀ bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í wò bàìbàì.
178,"It made his head swim, he started reeling.","Ójẹ́ kí orí rẹ̀ wú, óbẹ̀rẹ̀ si í pòòyì."
179,That was the way he wanted it.,Bí ó ṣe fẹ́ kí ó rí rè é.
180,He wanted to get intoxicated.,Ófẹ́ kí ọtí pa òun dáadáa.
181,"He had been told that the moment the beer sank into his system , his whole body would react.","Wọ́n ti sọ fún un pé nígbà tí ọtí bá wọ àgọ́ ara rẹ̀, gbogbo àgọ́ ara rẹ̀ á dáhùn sí i."
182,"The hair on his head would stand on end; his brain cells would go haywire, the eyelids would begin to close up; and then his whole frame would start turning round and round with the building – in the manner of a spaceship about to be launched into the outer orbit!","Irun orí rẹ̀ ádúró gírígírí,  àwọn páà dì ọpọlọ rẹ̀ á wá máa siṣẹ́-kiṣẹ́, ìpéǹpéjú rẹ̀ á máa padé; gbogbo ara rẹ̀ á wá máa yípo tilé tilé bíi ṣẹ́ ọkọ̀ òfurufú tí ó ṣ̀ẹ̀ṣẹ̀ já síta láti fi lọ́lẹ̀."
183,"Yes. That was how Alamu wanted it. He wanted his body – if possible – to be flung into the outer orbit, in an imaginary journey to the super-sensible world.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni.

184,"That would make him forget all the worries, all the cares of this material world – at least for some time.","Èyí lè jẹ́ kí ó gbàgbé gbogbo ìdààmú rẹ̀, àti gbogbo ìtọ́jú ayé - bí ó bá tiè jẹ́ fún ìgbà díẹ̀."
185,The smell of alcohol permeated the air inside the house. It escaped from the window panes in Alamu’s room and invaded the sitting room and Labake’s bedroom.,"Òórùn ọtí borí òórùn inú ilé.

186,"Labake sniffed it in instinctively, her curiosity was immediately aroused, she tip-toed to her husband’s bed room and peeped through the key hole… she nearly collapsed from what she saw, she was merely dreaming.","Làbákẹ́ gbọ́ òórùn yìí, tì fura tì fura ó yọ́ kẹ́lẹ́-kẹ́lẹ́ lọ sí yàrá ọkọ rẹ̀, ó sì yọjú láti ibi ihò kọ́kọ́rọ́…………….ó fẹ́ ẹ̀ ẹ́ dákú pẹ̀lú ohun tí ó rí, ó ṣebí àlá ni òun ń lá. "
187,She rubbed her eyes several times.,Ó fi ọwọ́ bọ́ ojú rè láìmọye ìgbà. 
188,The sound of the beer bottle knocking on Alamu’s mug came out compellingly loud and clear and Labake realized she was not dreaming at all. It was reality. Stark reality.,"Ohùn ìgò ọtí tí ó ń kan ife Àlàmú jáde geere-ge, Làbákẹ́ sì rí i pékì í ṣe àlá ni òun ń lá rárá. Òótọ́ ni, òótọ́ pátápátá."
189,"There in front of her was her husband, relaxing in the easy chair and sipping his beer with complete abandon – talking to himself and laughing all along! – an outlandish loud laugh.","Kòrókòró ni ó ń wo ọkọ rẹ̀ tí ó ń gbafẹ́ lórí àgbà-n-tara, ó sì ń mu ọtí rẹ̀ láìbìkítà - ó ń bá ara rẹ̀ sọ̀rọ̀, ó sì ń rín ẹ̀rín, ẹ̀rín àsàsàmọsì."
190,Labake crashed inside the room:,Làbákẹ́ já wọ yàrá náà:
191,"‘Alamu…Alamu…’ she began, ‘what is this that I see in front of you?","“Àlàmú………. Àlàmú”, óbẹ̀rẹ̀ ọ̀rọ̀, “Kíni èyí tí mò ń rí ní wájú rẹyìí?”"
192,"Alamu sat up straight, looked at labake with sunken, dreamy eyes and laughed out loud and long – louder than ever before.","Àlàmú jókòó sókè, ó wo Làbákẹ́ pẹ̀lú ojú jíjìn, ó sì rẹ́rìn-ínìyàngí tí ó gùn, tí ó pariwo ju ti tẹ́lè lọ."
193,"‘What ? This? You mean this?’ he asked rather unnecessarily, ‘oh that’s beer. What else can it be Laba… Labake?’","“Kí ni? Èyí? Ṣé èyí ni ò ń sọ?”, ó béèrè ìbéèrè tí kò wúlò……..ooooh! ọtí bíà. Kí lótún fẹ́ jẹ́ Làbá……. Làbákẹ́?”"
194,He breathed heavily. The casual tone of Alamu’s reply completely put Labake off.,Ó mí èémí líle. Èsì àìbìkítà Àlàmú ti mú ọ̀rọ̀ náà sú Làbákẹ́ pátápátá.
195,"‘That’s beer Labake,’ he stressed again, ‘Haven’t you… you eyes to…to see?’ Alamu’s impudent remark caught her off-guard.","“Ọtí nìyẹn Làbákẹ́”, ó tún fàágùn, “ṣé o…..o…..kò ní ojú láti ……….láti ríran ni?.....”Èsì àfojúdi Àlàmú bá Làbákẹ́ lójijì."
196,‘But you’ve never tasted beer all your life Alamu?’,"“Ṣùgbọ́n, o ò fẹnu kan ọtí rí láyé rẹ Àlàmú?"
197,"Yes… And therefore?... so therefore?’ Alamu snapped back, ‘you should know… you should know.","“Bẹ́ẹ̀  ni……….nígbà náà ńkọ́? Ìgbà náà wá ń kọ́?” Àlàmú fèsì padà, 'ó yẹ kí o mọ̀, ó yẹ kí o mọ̀."
198,Laba… Labak… em… I have to start it one day …And it is today… Today that … that em…so therefore?...i say so therefore!’,Làbá…..Làbák……ẹm... Mo ní láti bẹ̀rẹ ẹ̀ lọ́jọ́ kan.. òní sì ni………òní tí…….tí ẹm….fún ìdí èyí?........mo ní fún ìdí èyi!”
199,"He rose to his feet with some effort, held the mug of beer precariously to the lips and gulped the remaining content. He poured out for himself another mug and gulped it. Then some more again that one went down the stomach… and yet another… He looked angrily at the empty bottle of beer in his hand and flung it away.","Ó dìde lórí ẹsẹ rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú okun díẹ̀, ó sì di ife ọtí náà mú gírígírí sí ẹnu rẹ̀, ó sì da èyí tó ṣẹ́kù mu.

200,He tossed the empty mug across the stool in front of him and yelled with laughter.,"Ó ju kòròfo ife kọjá sí orí àpótí iwájú rẹ, ó sì bú sẹ́rìn-ín."
201,‘What Alamu!’ Labake shouted. Her eyes caught the cigarettes her husband was holding between the two fingers of his left hand.,"Làbákẹ́ pariwo, “kí rè é Àlàmú!” Ojú rẹ̀ rí sìgá tí ọkọ rẹ̀ mú sáàárín ìka méjì lọ́wọ́ òsì rẹ̀."
202,‘You’ve started smoking too.’,“O ti ń fa sìgá náà”
203,"Alamu did not answer. He looked away, lit the cigarette and start puffing at it. He brought together his lips, like a stringed purse, and the smoke he blew out formed an intricate, crisis-cross pattern on its way up the ceiling!","Àlàmú kò dá a lóhùn.

204,‘Alamu?... Alamu? Is that you Alamu? Drinking and smoking?’ Labake asked in disbelief.,"“Àlàmú!...... Àlàmú! Ṣé ìwọ rè é Àlàmú? ọtí àti sìgá?”, Làbákẹ́ béèrè pẹ̀lú àìgbàgbọ́."
205,"Alamu laughed nervously and took another deep, long puff. His eyes bulged. This time the smoke went into the wrong way and he started coughing…","Àlàmú rẹ́rìn-ín pẹ̀lú àìbalẹ̀ àyà, ó sì tún sìgá rẹ̀ fà pẹ́ dáadáa. Ojú rẹ̀ ràn kankan.

206,‘Ex… Excuse me Labake… Hum… you see…you see…em…’,“Forí... foríjìmí Làbákẹ́... hùn... ṣo rí i... ṣo rí i... ẹ̀… ǹ…”
207,‘see what?’,“Rí kíni?”

210,Alamu staggered towards Labake. His knees wobbled. He held Labake by the shoulder and shook her violently. Alamu’s head had started turning around. He liked it that way. He ‘d forgotten all his problems. His problems had been solved now – straight away! No more sorrow!,Àlàmú ta gíẹ́gíẹ́ sọ́dọ̀ Làbákẹ́. Orúnkún rẹ̀ wọ́lẹ̀.

211,"‘Look… look at me properly… properly, woman.

212,"Labake looked at her husband’s red eyeballs and screamed… was he going to strike her? Was he going to strangle her? He held her so tight now, he might, in th final analysis, strangle her- no one could tell…","Làbákẹ́ wojú ọkọ rẹ̀ pípọ́n, ó sì pariwo... ṣé yóò lù ú ni?

213,‘Don’t…Don’t you…you worry…I say! Don’t you worry… ol’…woman!’ Alamu stammered.,"“Má…má ṣe da ara rẹ láàmú…mo ní!Má ṣe………da…..…ara………..rẹ láàmú…...Arúgb….obìnrin”, Àlàmú ká lòlò."

218,"Alamu laughed, let go his hands, and grrh – grrh –grrh! – down came the contents of his bowel in a prolonged vomit that left  Labake’s dress thoroughly drenched and soiled!","Àlàmú rẹ́rìn-ín, ó tú ọwọ́ rẹ̀ kúrò…….ó ṣe gììrì………gììrì…….gbogbo ohun tó wà nínú agbẹ̀du rẹ̀ pátápátá ni óbì jáde.

219,"Then he started coughing… The more he coughed, the more the waste product inside his bowel gushed out through the mouth and nostrils!","Lẹ́yìn náà ni ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í húkọ́, bí ó ṣe húkọ́ yìí ni àwọn èsùn pàǹtí yòókù tí ó wà ní agbẹ̀du rẹ̀ ń jáde láti ẹnu àti ihò imú rẹ̀!"
220,"It was a moment Labake would never forget. She did not sleep at all through the night, she thought over what exactly the matter could be with her husband.","Àsìkòyìí jẹ́ àsìkò tí Làbákẹ́ kò lè gbàgbé láéláé.

221,"She had heard him talk several times to himself in his sleep, she had heard that strange laughter many times.","Ó ti máa ń gbọ́ tí ọkọ rẹ̀ dá sọ̀rọ̀ lójú oorun láìmọye ìgbà, ó ti gbọ́ ẹ̀rín abàmì tí ọkọ rẹ̀ ń rín níìgbà púpọ̀."
222,"And now for Alamu, it was ‘weed weed and wine… wine wine and weed!’","Nísinsìnyí, ọ̀rọ̀ Àlàmú ti di igbó igbó fí fààti ọtí mímu………ọtí mímu àti igbó fífà."
223,what could make him so desperate? Something obviously was amiss. The truth must be discovered…,Kíni nǹkan tí ó lè sọ ọ́ di ọ̀dájú báyìí? Dájú dájú nǹkankan ń kán. Ó sì gbọ́dọ̀ wádìí òtító...
224,"She set about that in a business-like fashion, following her husband all about the house like a shadow. For many days, she kept azing intently at him, watching his demeanour, watching his comportment.","Ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ èyí ní pẹrẹ, ó ń tẹ̀lé ọkọ rẹ̀ káàkiri inú ilébí i òjìjí.

225,"She followed him to the sitting room and engaged him in conversation, she accompanied him to the car park to wash the car. At the backyard of the house, they were always together – with labake taking note of every word, every utterance her husband made.","Ó tẹ̀lé e lọ sí yàrá ìgbàlejò, ó sì ń bá a tàkùrọ̀sọ, ó tún sìn ín lọ sí ọgbà ìgbọ́kọ̀sí láti bá a fọ ọkọ̀ rẹ̀ ní ẹ̀hìn kùlé ilé wọn, wọ́njọ ń wà papọ̀ -  Làbákẹ́ sì ń ṣàkíyèsí gbogbo ọ̀rọ̀ ẹnu rẹ̀."
226,"And whenever Alamu went inside the toilet, Labake too was always around, peeping through the key hole of the toilet, watching.","Nígbàkugbà tí Àlàmú bá wọ ilé ìtọ̀, Làbáké náà ádúró nítòsí, á máa yọjú láti ibi ihò kọ́kọ́rọ́ ilèkùn ilé ìtọ̀."

232,"There was nothing Labake could do to make Alamu complete his sentence. He would gesticulate, nod his head, point a finger, tap the table and that would be the end of that sentence!","Kò sí ohun tí Làbákẹ́ lè ṣe láti jẹ́kí Àlàmú parí gbólóhùn rẹ̀.

233,"But Labake got one fact out of it all, and that was what she now held unto.","Àmọ́, Làbákẹ́ ti rí àrídájú kan mú jáde nínú gbogbo èyí, òhun tí ó sìfúnka mọ́ nìyí."
234,"ALL Alamu’s uncompleted sentences had to do with going somewhere to visit somebody to fulfil a promise, to offer an explanation about something to clarify an issue to supply a piece of information…",Gbogbo àkùdè gbólóhùn  Àlàmú yìí níí ṣe pẹ̀lú lílọ sí ibìkan láti lọ rí ẹnìkan láti lọ mú ìlérí kan ṣe tàbí láti lọ ṣàlàyé nǹkan tàbí láti wá ojútùú sí ọ̀rọ̀ kan  tàbí  láti ta wọ́n lólobó nípa nǹkan...
235,Alamu had opened himself up to suspicion! He had questions to answer!,Àlàmú ti tú ara rẹ̀ fó! Ó ní ìbéèrè láti dáhùn.
236,"Labake remembered only two occasions when she fought Alamu over secret lovers, but that was in London.","Làbákẹ́ rántí ẹ̀ẹ̀méjì péré tí ó ti bá Àlàmú jà nípa olólùfẹ́ ìkọ̀kọ̀, ṣùgbọ́n nígbà tí wọ́n wà ní Lọ́ńdọ́ọ̀nù ni èyí."
237,"First, it was on account of Josephine, the Jamaican professional belly dancer based in London.","Lákọ̀ọ́kọ́, nítorí Josephine ọmọ ìlú Jàmáíkà, tí ó jẹ́ ògbólógbòó afikùnjó nílùú Lọ́ńdọ́ọ̀nù."
238,"Labake had accompanied Alamu to the theatre at Leicester Square in London to watch Josephine perform that day. It was a good show. Graceful Josephine wriggled her shapely hips seductively, to the rhythmof the tom-tom, trumpet and the cymbal – to the admiration of the audience. Alamu was particularly excited.",Làbákẹ́ sin Àlàmú lọ sí tíátà ní gbàgede Luchester láti lọ wòran ijó rẹ̀. Ó jẹ́ ìran tó dùn-ún wò.

239,Labake looked at Alamu and saw in his eyes a slow burn of passion for Josephine and she had warned him there and then to take his time – to play it cool. Shye had thought that the end of it all – that the matter had been laid to rest.,"Làbákẹ́ wo Àlàmú lójú, ó sì rí ìfẹ́ Josephine lójú rẹ̀, ó sì kìlòfún un lójú ẹsẹ̀. Ó sì ti rò ó wí pé Àlàmú ti gbọ́ràn."
240,"But at a latter day, Labake retrieved three of Josephine’s pictures from inside the breast pocket of Alamu’s coat… Then there was the day Labake caught him alone with Josephine at the park.","Ṣùgbọ́n lẹ́yìn ìgbà náà, Làbákẹ́ rí àwòrán Josephine mẹ́ta nínú àpò àyà aṣọ Àlàmú.

241,"For one whole week a cold war raged between Alamu and Labake. But finally, they made up.","Fún ọsẹ kan gbáko, ogun tútù wáyé láàárín Àlàmú pẹ̀lú Làbákẹ́. ṣùgbọ́n wọ́n parí ẹ̀ nígbẹ̀yìn gbẹ́yín."
242,"The next quarrel with Alamu was over Caroline, a law student from Kenya.","Aáwọ̀ mìíràn tó tún wáyé láàárín wọn wáyé nítorí Caroline, akẹ́kọ̀ọ́ ìmọ̀-òfin láti ìlú Kẹ́ńyà."
243,"She caught them at Trafalgar Square in the heart of London, playing with pigeons and taking photographs below the giant Nelson Statue!","Làbákẹ́ káwọn ní gbàgede Trafalgar láàárín gùngùn ìlú Lọ́ńdọ́ọ̀nù, wọ́n ń fi ẹyẹlẹ́ ṣere tíwọ́n sì ń ya àwòrán lábẹ́ ère Nelson ńlá!"
244,She hailed on them from inside the city bus that was taking her across to Albany Street – letting them know they’d been caught.,"Ó ké sí wọn láti inú ọkọ̀-akéròìlú tí ó ń gbé e lọ sí òpópónà Albany, ó fẹ́ kí wọ́n mọ̀ pé òun ti ká wọn."
245,"Labake kept her cool until the time she saw both of them again at Hyde Park where they stood arm in arm, listening to the chattering of a public speaker at the Park corner.","Làbákẹ́ kò bá a jà, àfi ìgbà tí ó tún rí àwọn méjèèjì ní ọgbà ìṣeré Hyde, ní bi tí wọ́n ti jọ dúró, tí wọ́n sì fọwọ́ kọ́ ara wọn lọ́rùn, tí wọn sì ń tẹ́tí sí sọ̀rọ̀-sọ̀rọ̀ kan tí ó ń sọ̀rọ̀ ní kọ̀rọ̀ ọgbà ìṣeré náà."
246,"Alamu had told Labake he was going for his lecture at College just at the time she caught him at the famous London Gossip Corner with Caroline. That day, hell was let loose.","Àlàmú sì ti sọ fún Làbákẹ́ wí pé òun ń lọ fún ìdánilẹ́kọ̀ọ́ ní kọ́lẹ́ẹ̀jì ní déédé ásìkò yẹn.

247,"And it seems the end of their association had come. But latter, again with the effective intervention of Alamu’s friends in London, everything was settled.","Ó sì fẹ́ jọ ọ́ pé òpin ti dé bá ìbáṣepò wọn. ṣùgbọ́n nígbà tó yá, àwọn ọ̀rẹ́ Àlàmú nílùú Lọ́ńdọ́ọ̀nù dá sí ọ̀rọ̀ wọn, gbogbo rẹ̀ sì níì yanjú."
248,That was England Labake reflected again…,Làbákẹ́ tún sọjí pé ìlú Englandì nìyẹn…………………….
249,"Here in Nigeria there was nobody to supect except perhaps Alamu’s secretary. The secretary took her telephone call on two occasions. Her, ‘can I help you?’ expression on the phone irritated Labake so much.","Níhìn-ín orílẹ̀-èdè Nàìjíríà, kò sí ẹni tí ó lè fura sí… bóyá akọ̀wé Àlàmú níbi iṣẹ́.

250,"She had said it on those two occasion with a care-free, impudent  tone, and she didn’t  quite like it.","Ọmọbìnrin  náà ti sọ èyí fún un pẹ̀lú ohùn àfojúdi àti àìbìkítà lẹ́ẹ̀mejì ọ̀tọ̀ọ̀tọ̀ náà, kò sì fẹ́ràn èyí."
251,"During the second telephone call, Labake wanted to shout back at the lady, ‘No! No! stop it! You can’t help me! Just give me my husband. Put me through to my husband quickly. And leave us to talk alone. Nothing more. You can’t help me lady!’",Nígbà ìpè kejì ni Làbákẹ́ fẹ́ jágbe mọ́ ọn “Rárá Rárá! Dánu Dúró! O ò lè ràn mí lọ́wọ́!

252,"Labake  had called at Alamu’s office one day. And that day, his messenger had told her  oga was busy inside and did not want to be disturbed. Busy doing what?  Labake had wondered.","Làbákẹ́ tún lọ sí ọ́fíìsì Àlàmú lọ́jọ́ kan. Lọ́jọ́ náà ni ìráńṣẹ́ ọ́fíìsì Àlàmú sọ fún un pé “ọ̀gá ń ṣiṣẹ́ lọ́wọ́”, kò sì fẹ́ kí ẹnikẹ́ni dí i lọ́wọ́.  Làbákẹ́ ronú, kí ló lè máa ṣe?"
253,‘Do let him know it’s Labake waiting to see him!’,“Jẹ́ kí ó mọ̀ pé Làbákẹ́ ni ó fẹ́ rí i!”.
254,Labake heard some muffled-tone whisperings coming from Alamu’s air-conditioned office and blood gushed inside her veins.,Làbákẹ́ gbọ́ ohùn wẹ́rẹ́ – wẹ́rẹ́ tí ó ń jáde láti ọ́fíìsì Àlàmú tí ẹ̀rọ amúlétutù wà……..ẹ̀jẹ̀ sì rọ́ wọ inú iṣan rẹ̀.
255,"‘Go and deliver my message to him,’ she said, almost shouting, ‘I am Mrs. Alamu Olaoye.’ The  messenger slipped inside his boss’s office and came out in another minute to tell Labake:","“Lọ jíṣẹ́ fún un”, ó sọ̀rọ̀, ó fẹ́rẹ̀ é máa pariwo. “Èmi ni ìyáàfin  Àlàmú Ọláoyè”.

257,Labake cast one hateful look at the messenger and entered to find Alamu and his secretary in what seemed to her as tete-a-tete. The secretary was taking down some dictation to prepare an important official document. Labake’s  crimson eyeballs burnt the secretary down to ashes!,"Làbákẹ́ fi ojú burúkú wo òjí ṣẹ́ náà, ó sì wọlé, ó rí ọkọ rẹ̀ àti akọ̀wé ní ipò tí ó fu ú lára.

258,"And she listened, irritated, as Alamu whispered the instruction which the secretary scribbled down nodding her head and smilling.","Ó sì ń tẹ́tí, pẹ̀lú ìnira bí, Àlàmú ṣe ń sọ àwọn àlàyé tí akọ̀wé náà ń kọ sílẹ̀ ní kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́ tí akọ̀wé náà ń kanrí mọ́lẹ̀, tí ó sì ń rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́."
259,Well…if there was one woman in Alamu’s life it might as well be ths damned secretary.,"Nítorí náà, bí ọmọbìnrin kan bá wà nínú ìgbésí ayé Àlàmú, ó lè jẹ́ akọ̀wé olórí burúkú yìí."
260,Labake subjected herself to mental torture.,Làbákẹ́ jọ̀wọ́ ara rẹ̀ fún ìpòruru ọpọlọ.
261,She grew weary of the task and wanted to sleep.,"Iṣẹ́ náà ti ń sú u, ó sì fẹ́ sùn."
262,But her head continued aching badly. The heavy snoring inside Alamu’s room came frightfully into her ears.,Ṣùgbọ́n orí ń fọ́ ọ gidi. Híhànrun wúwo láti inú yàrá Àlàmú ń jáde wá sí etí rẹ̀ tìbẹ̀rù-tìbẹ̀rù.
263,It blasted the silence of the night like an open throttled lorry and crashed through Labake’s central nervous system like a chainsaw laying waste a forest.,"Dídún yìí borí ìdákẹ́ rọ́rọ́ òru bí i ọkọ̀ àjàgbé tí ìjánu rẹ̀ ti ṣí sílẹ̀, ó sì wọ Làbákẹ́ ní akínyẹmí ara bíi ayùn ẹlẹ́gbà tí ó ba igbó jẹ́."
264,"Alamu slept like a king in now, forcing all lesser mortals to stay awake!",Àlàmú sùn falala nígbà tí ó fi tiẹ̀ dí gbogbo ayé lọ́wọ́!
265,"The solitary voice of the Imam came out loud over the loud-speaker early one morning, summoning all ‘servant of God’ to prayer.","Ohùn ìmáàmù já geere lórí ariwo ẹ̀rọ amóhùndúngbẹ̀mù ní kùtùkùtù òwúrò ọjọ́ kan, tí ó ń pe àwọn ẹrú Ọlọ́run láti wá kírun."

272,"At that time of the day, only a few people were usually ready to make the supreme effort to rise.","Ní irú àsìk òyìí, àwọn ènìyàn díẹ̀ ni wọn ti máa ń gbaradì láti gbìyànjú àti dìde."
273,"Maybe ten per cent of all the adherents. And reluctantly too, these few would lumber awkwardly towards the various mosques in town – their eyelids still heavy with sleep.",Bóyá ìdá mẹ́wàá nínú ọgọ́rùn-ún àwọn ẹlẹ́sìn náà.

274,"The rest of the people – ‘logs’ were doomed! Meaning that there would be congestion right from the gates of jaa-non-mo to its innermost part, on the day of reckoning!","Àwọn ènìyàn yòókù tí wọ́n sùn kalẹ̀bí igi ni ìparun dé bá!

275,"The imam’s voice came out loud, piercing the stillness of the cold early morning air. Labake checked the time almost five… Yes five o’ clock.","Ohùn ìmáàmù jáde dáadáa, ó sì gún ìdákẹ́rọ́rọ́ òwúrọ̀ kùtùkùtù tútù.

276,That seemed the most appropriate time to talk to Alamu. To ask him a few questions. The best time to give him a thorough curtain lecture.,"Ó jọ àsìkò tí ó yẹ láti bá Àlàmú sọ̀rọ̀.

277,There was perfect quiet and tranquility everywhere in the house now. The only sound that came to Labake’s ears was that of the alarm clock slowly ticking away the seconds.,Ìdákẹ́rọ́rọ́ tí ó péye ṣì wà nínú ilé báyìí.

278,Labake entered Alamu’s room without knocking – and got the the greatest shock of her life – Alamu was not around! The room was empty! She hastened to the bathroom and the toilet. There was no trace of her husband!,"Làbákẹ́ wọ yàrá Àlàmú láì kan lẹ̀kùn, ó sì rí ohun ìyálenu ìjayà tí ó tóbi jù láyé rẹ̀! Àlàmú kò sí ní ilé! Inú yàrá ṣófo!

279,The car park was empty Labake stood transfixed for a moment not knowing what else to do…,"Ọgbà ìgbọ́kọ̀-sí ti ṣófo. Làbákẹ́ dúró tìyanu-tìyanu fún ìgbà díẹ̀, láìmọ ohun tí ó fẹ́ ṣe…………………………."
280,"Yesterday night she remembered, she bid her husband good night before going to sleep. Alamu had nodded his head in answer and soon she heard the grating noise of the door lock – then, his snoring…","Ní alẹ́ àná, ó rántí pé òun kí ọkọ òun pé “ó dàárò” kí ó tó lọ sùn.

281,"Now Alamu had gone out without letting her know his destination, his mission. And at suc odd hour of the day gone to some secret lover. ‘no doubt! The air was cold and chilly and the pang of jealousy that suddenly gripped Labake now made her desire the company of her husband more than ever before. The urge came to her rather spontaneously.","Nísinsìnyí, Àlàmú  ti jáde láì dágbére, kò jẹ́ kí ó mọ èrò ọkàn rẹ̀.

282,"She imagined her husband in gthe warm embrace of his secret lover this cold morning, she swallowed some saliva. But that was not the issue now.","Ó ń ro bí ọkọ rẹ̀ ṣe ma máa dì mọ́ olólùfẹ́ ìkọ̀kọ̀ rẹ̀ ní òwúrọ̀ tútù yìí, ó sì gbé itọ́ mì. ṣùgbọ́n kì í ṣe ohun tó ṣe kókó nìyẹn."
283,Labake went back into her lonely room. Lonely now to her even with little Tinu’s presence in the room! She waited patiently. This incident had given Alamu an additional question to answer.,Làbákẹ́ padà sí yàrá rẹ̀ tó dá wà. Ìdáwà yìí pọ̀ tóbẹ́ẹ̀ pẹ̀lú bí Tinú kékeré ṣe wà nínú yàrá!

284,"Later in the morning that day at about ten o’ clock, Labake heard the sound of Alamu’s car. ‘Soon Alamu himself was knocking at the door. Anxiously, Labake made  for the door and saw that Alamu was not alone. There were two other men in his company. They followed closely behind him as he entered the house.","Nígbà tí ilẹ̀ mọ́ dáadáa lọ́jọ́ náà ni nǹkan bíi aago mẹ́wàá, Làbákẹ́ gbọ́ ohùn ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ Àlàmú .

285,"Labake threw a questioning glance at Alamu. Then transferred her puzzled gaze to the two men who accompanied him. The two men shot back their own glances, impudently, at Labake. Labake hated them at once.","Làbákẹ́ wo Àlàmú  pẹ̀lú ẹ̀mí ìbéèrè.

314,"Soon, the two visitors set at work. And one by one they started disconnecting the items.

333,"Labake gazed intently at the face of her husband. A steady, penetrating gaze. A search - the- secret-of-my-soul gaze! Alamu blushed, opened his mouth wide like the hyena and laughed. His voice rumbled like thunder, rocking the building almost to its very foundations.","Làbákẹ́ wo ojú ọkọ rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú àìgbàgbọ́. Ó tẹjú mọ́ ọn rorooro.

334,‘ha ha ha ha - hum hum… Leave them – ha ha ha ha - hum hum...’,Ha……ha……ha……hun….hun………fi wọ́n lẹ̀……ha……ha…..hun hun...
335,Labake wanted to scream. What strange laughter was this? What was the matter? What's all these tall tales for? Screeching noise on the ceiling fan? She'd never heard it Blurred picture on the TV? - She'd never seen it!.,Làbákẹ́ fẹ́ pariwo. Irú ẹ̀rín abàmì wo rè é? Kíló le tóyìí? Kíni gbogbo àwọn ìtàn gígùn yìí wà fún?

338,"But when the noise of Alamu's fresh outburst of laughter reached her ears from inside Alamu's room again, she allowed the gathering tears to rain down her cheeks in care-free torrents.","Ṣùgbọ́n nígbà tí aruwo ẹ̀rín Àlàmú  mìíràn tún dé etí ìgbó rẹ̀ láti yàrá Àlàmú, ó gba omi ojú wọ̀nyí láàyè láti yára ṣàn wá sí ẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ rẹ̀ láìdáwọ́dúró."
339,He'd probably started to furnish the house of the other woman in town.

340,"But that grotesque laugh of her husband's. It continued to re-echo in her brain coming to her forcefully again and again like the terrible clang of a thousand bells.

341,"In the picture hanging on the wall just in front of her in the siting room was Alamu, holding her hand lovingly on their wedding day, a broad happy smile on his face. He looked handsome. The smile was real, natural and sincere.","Nínú àwòrán tíwọ́n gbé kọ́ ògiri níwájú rẹ̀ gan-an ni Àlàmú  wà, bí ó ṣe di ọwọ́ rẹ̀ mú tìfẹ́-tìfẹ́ lọ́jọ́ ìgbéyàwó wọn pẹ̀lú ẹ̀rín ìdùnnú lójú rẹ̀.

342,"On their first night together after their expensive wedding ceremony, Alamu had shouted to her in joy.","Ní alẹ́ àkọ́kọ́ lẹ́yìn ayẹyẹ ìgbéyàwó olówó iyebíye tíwọ́n ṣe, Àlàmú  pariwo síi pẹ̀lú ayọ̀."

345,That was in obvious reference to those people who held the view that their marriage would never come through – Alamu’s old mother inclusive.,"Láìsí àní-àní, èyí ń bá àwọn tí wọ́n ní i lọ́kàn pé ìgbéyàwó yìí kò ní wáyé – láì yọ ìyá Àlàmú  sílẹ̀."
346,"She had been so sceptical about the success of that union between her son and this little girl from a different ethnic group, this girl who looked so sophisticated and so sharp - like the point of a needle; this girl whose lips never closed - a human talking machine; this girl who read so much – and was consequently, so swollen headed.","Ìyá náà kò fara mọ́ ìbáṣepò ọmọ rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú ọmọbìnrin tí ó wá láti ẹ̀yà mìí ràn yìí, ọmọbìnrin tí ó dá ṣáṣá tó sì já fáfá - bí i ẹnu abẹ́rẹ́; ọmọbìnrin ẹlẹ́jọ wẹ́wẹ́ yìí; tí ó kàwé gan-an tí ìgbéraga sì ti gùn."
347,"Alamu's people wanted for their son, a woman whose breasts the baby would be allowed to suck with relish and satisfaction, at all times; a woman whose back the baby would be allowed to mount and beat lovingly with its tiny fingers under the secure grip of the oja and the iro; a woman who herself would be able to sing the traditional lullaby in sonorous voice to send the baby to sound sleep.","Àwọn ẹbí Àlàmú  fẹ́ obìnrin tí yóò fún ọmọ lọ́mú lámuyó ní gbogbo ìgbà, obìnrin tí ẹ̀yìn rẹ̀ gba ọ̣mọ̣, tí yóò ró ìró gírígírí tí á sì fún ọ̀já mọ́ ọ̀n; obìnrin tí yóò lè kọ àwọn orin ìrẹmọlẹ́kún pẹ̀lú ohùn dídùn láti lè rẹ ọmọ tẹ́."

350,"Especially when he remembered how Labake had packed up her secretarial practice course in London, complaining that the course was too academic.","Pàápàá, bí ó bá rán tí bí Làbákẹ́ ṣe pa kọ́ọ̀ sìi ṣẹ́ akọ̀wé rẹ̀ tì ní Lọ́ńdọ́ọ̀nù tí ó ṣe àwáwí pé ìwé ti pọ̀jù fún òun láti kà."
351,He remembered how they had both sat down and settled for a hairdressing and modelling course for Labake. A course which finally fetched her a diploma.,Ó rántí bí wọ́n ṣe dìjọ jókòó fẹnu kò sí i pé kí Làbákẹ́ lọ ṣe kọ́ọ̀sì aṣerun lóge àti oge ṣíṣe níbi tí ó ti jàjà gba ìwé-ẹ̀rí Dípúlómà.
352,Alamu kept all these details to himself. He did not argue with his people.,Àlàmú fi gbogbo èyí sí inú ara rẹ̀. Kò bá àwọn ènìyàn rẹ̀ jiyàn.
353,He just went ahead with his own plans.,Ó kàn tẹ̀síwájú pẹ̀lú ohun tó ní lọ́kàn.
354,"He did not tell them Labake was not a ‘book lady', he did not tell them she was only a trained beautician.","Kò sọ fún wọn pé Làbákẹ́ kì í ṣe obìnrin onìwée púpọ̀, kò sọ ọ́fún wọn pé aṣara lọ́sọ̀ọ́ tó kọ́ṣẹ́-mọṣé ni."
355,Alamu did not tell his people that Labake had made her own small mark in London as a model.,Àlàmú kò sọfún àwọn ènìyàn rẹ̀ pé ó ti gba àmì ti rẹ̀gẹ́gẹ́ bí i aṣaralọ́ṣọ̀ọ́ nílùú Lọ́ńdọ́ọ̀nù.
356,Nobody saw all those magazine and newspapers where Labake featured as pin-up girl.,Kò sí ẹni tí ó rí gbogbo àwọn magasíinì àti ìwé ìròyìn tí Làbákẹ́ ti fara hàn gẹ́gẹ́ bíi omidan ológe àwòmáleèlọ.
357,The only person who knew all the details was his bosom friend - Adio - who was then a law student in London.,"Ènìyàn kan ṣoṣo tó mọ̀ nípa gbogbo èyí ni Àdìó, ọ̀rẹ́ tímọ́tímọ́ Àlàmú tí ó jẹ́ akẹ́kọ̀ọ́ ìmọ̀-òfin nígbà náà ní Lọ́ńdọ́ọ̀nù."
358,"But indirectly, Alamu's old mother nearly got to know of the professional aspect of Labake's life the day she was looking through Labake's photo album. That was shortly after their marriage.","Díẹ̀ ló kù kí ìyá Àlàmú mọ irú iṣẹ́ tí Làbákẹ́ yàn láàyò láyé rẹ̀, lọ́jọ́ tí ó ń wo àwòrán inú ìwé ìfàwò ránsí rẹ̀ ní kété tí wọ́n ṣe ìgbéyàwó."
359,"‘Hum.., hum.. Is this your wife Alamu?","Hùn hùn, ṣé ìyàwó rẹ rè é Àlàmú?"
360,"Is this Labake? the old woman asked, pointing to the enlarged picture of a lady wearing tight jeans, open-neck blouse, and smiling radiantly.","Ṣé Làbákẹ́ rè é? ìyá àgbà náà ń bèèrè, ó nawó sí àwòrán ọmọbìnrin tí ó wọ ṣòkòtò jíǹsì tó lẹ̀ mọ́ ọn lára típẹ́ típẹ́ pẹ̀lú èwù péńpé tó fàyàá lẹ̀, ó sì rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́."
361,"Alamu looked closer - not for recognition but for admiration. Yes, it was Labake in an elegant posture. The vital statistics of her firm young body showed clearly, alluringly.","Àlàmú  wò ó dáadáa, kì í ṣe fún ìdánimọ̀ ṣùgbọ́n fún pípọ́n ẹwà rẹ̀ lé.

362,That was Labake's picture which won the first prize in a London magazine competition.,Àwòrán Làbákẹ́ tí ó gba àmì ẹ̀yẹ ipò kìn-ín-ní nínú ìfigagbága magasíìnì Lọ́ńdọ́ọ̀nù nìyẹn.
363,The picture which adorned the front page Man's World magazine.,Àwòrán tí wọ́n gbé sí ojú magasíìnì “Man”s world”.
364,The picture which earned Labake two thousand British pounds and resulted in over two hundred letters of adoration from the appreciative readers of ‘Man's World' all over England.,Àwòrán tí ó pa ẹgbẹ̀rún méjì pọ́n-ùn bìrìtì kó sápò Làbákẹ́ tí ó sì yọrí sí lẹ́tà ìbu-ọlá-fún tó lé ní igba láti ọ̀dọ̀ àwọn òǹkàwé magasíìnì “Man”s world” tó mọ rírì káàkiri gbogbo Íngílandì.
365,"They wanted her address. They wanted to take her out for lunch, for dinner, to the pictures. They wanted her to visit them, to send her photographs - and so on and so on.","Wọ́n ń fẹ́ àdírẹ́sì. Wọ́n ń fẹ́ gbé e lọ jẹ oúnjẹ ọ̀sán, oúnjẹ alẹ́, láti jọ lọ ya àwòrán.

366,"‘Look Alamu’, Mama had continued, ‘your wife does not cover her chest. She exposes her breasts.","Màmá tẹ̀síwájú pẹ̀lú ọ̀rọ̀ rẹ̀, “wò ó Àlàmú, ìyàwó rẹ kì í bo àyà. Ó ń ṣí ọmú rẹ̀ sílẹ̀."
367,A woman should not do that. You yourself did not ask your wife to button up her blouse  properly....’,Kò yẹ kí obìnrin ṣe eléyìí. Ìwọ fún ra à rẹ kò lè sọ fún ìyàwó rẹ kí ó de bọ́tíìnì aṣọ rẹ̀ dáadáa...”.
368,Mama opened to another page of the album:,Màmá tún ṣí ojú ìwé mìíràn nínú ìwé àwòrán náà:
369,"And now, look, Alamu see your wife exposing her stomach. See the way Labake parts her thighs, the way she stretches out her legs'.","“Wá wò ó Àlàmú, wo ìyàwó rẹ bí ó ti ṣí ikùn sílẹ̀. Wo bí Làbákẹ́ ṣe yẹ itan, wo bí ó ṣe na ẹsẹ̀."
370,Mama again opened to another page and mused irritably as her eyes caught other pictures.,"Màmá tún ṣí ojú ìwé mìíràn, ó sì pòṣé pẹ̀lú ìrira bí ojú rẹ̀ ṣe ń rí àwọn àwòrán mìíràn."
371,See another bad one... See your wife rolling on the ground throwing one leg up to the wind.,“Wo òmíràn tó burú jáì... Wo ìyàwó rẹ bí ó ti ń yí ní ilẹ̀ẹ́lẹ̀ tí ó sì ju ẹsẹ̀ kan sókè.
372,See this one... And this one too!’ Mama threw down Labake's album looking sad and displeased.,"“Wo eléyìí,……àti ……eléyìí náà!”. Màmá ju ìwé àwòrán Làbákẹ́ sílẹ̀pẹ̀lú ìbànújẹ́, ó hàn pé eléyìí kọ̀ tẹ́ ẹ lọ́rùn."
373,Her relationship with Labake was a patch- patch' one.,Ìbáṣepò rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú Làbákẹ́ kò dán mọ́rán rárá.
374,"And each time they met, it was the proverbial hunter Ogungbe meeting the cunning monkey of the savannah forest.","Ìgbàkigbà tí wọ́n bá pàdé, ọ̀rọ̀ wọn máa ń dà bíi òwe “Àáyáà ti Ògúngbè”, ọdẹ ni Ògúngbè, ó gẹ̀gùn sílẹ̀ de àáyá."
375,"The cunning monkey would stand high on his toes and strain his neck to fish out Ogungbe and escape imminent death,","Bí àáyá ti ń bọ̀, ó kóra ro, nítorí pé ó fura pé ewu ń bẹ nítòsí. Ó nàró, ó wò yíká."
376,"But, clever man Ogungbe, on the other hand, would stoop low to the ground, almost kissing the dust, with his gun ready for the final kill.","Ògúngbè tó ń dúró dè é bẹ̀rẹ̀ mọ́lè. Nígbà tí àáyá kò rí nǹkan abàmì, ótún bẹ̀rẹ̀ mọ́lẹ̀. Ògúngbè tí ó ń ṣọ́ ọ náà nàró, ó ń gbaradì láti yìn ín ní bájínátù."
377,"Mama's attitude, by and large, did not seem to worry Labake. It did not bother her - at least initially. She continued patching on with Mama and Alamu was very happy that, there was no confrontation.","Ìhùwàsí àti ìṣesí Màmá kò ṣe Làbákẹ́ ní nǹkan. Kò tiẹ̀ mì ín rárá. Ó ń fara mọ́ gbogbo ìwà màmá, inú Àlàmú  sì dùn pé kò sí ìjà kankan."
378,"It was therefore an irony that all of Labake's worries had nothing to do with Mama or any other person. But with the very man who brought her in, for better for worse'.",Ìyálenu ni pé gbogbo wàhálà Làbákẹ́ kò nínǹkan ṣe pẹ̀lú màmá tàbí ẹlòmìíràn. Bí kò ṣe ọkùnrin tó gbé e wọlé fún “ìgbà tó dára àti ìgbà tó burú”.
379,"Alamu was doing everything possible to get on her nerves, to embarrass her.","Àlàmú ń ṣe gbogbo ohun tó ṣeéṣe láti bíi nínú, láti dà á láàmú."
380,It was deliberate. He'd taken to drinking and smoking.,"Ó ń mọ̀ọ́mọ̀. Ó ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ si ímu ọtí, ó sì ń fa sìgá."
381,"She could no longer vouch for him. He now moved with all sorts of people - ruffians, people of doubtful character - the typical dubious men of the city.","Kò lè gba ẹ̀rí rẹ̀ jẹ́ mọ́. Oríṣìírísìí àwọn ènìyàn ni ó ti ń bá rìn – àwọn oní jàgídíjàgan, àwọn tíì wọn ṣà ìdáni lójú – irú àwọn ọkùnrin ìgboro."
382,"Alamu confronted her all the time with the scornful, hyena laughter.",Ẹ̀rín ìkoòkò afiniṣẹ̀sín ni Àlàmú  máa ń fi dojú kọ ọ́ ní gbogbo ìgbà.
383,What was laughable about her? Why was he poking fun at her?,Kí ni nǹkan tó ń pa Àlàmú  lẹ́rìn-ín nípa rẹ̀? Kí ni ìdí tó ṣe ń fi òun ṣe yẹ̀yẹ́?
384,"What offence had she committed? None that she could think of. So, she would not go to appeal to him or to beg him. On the contrary, she would watch. She would lie in wait for what would be the outcome of his present lunatic action.","Ẹ̀ṣẹ̀ wo ni òun dá gan an? Kòsí èyi to wa sọkan rẹ̀. Kí ó tiẹ̀ lọbẹ́ẹ̀ tàbí kí ó pẹ̀tù sí i nínú. Ní ìlòdì sí èyí, á máa wò ó. Ádúró de ohun tí yóò jẹ́ àbájáde ìṣe wèrè tí ó ń ṣe lọ́wọ́."
385,Her own temper was quick too. She too could be difficult.,"Làbákẹ́ náà kìí pẹ́ bínú. Kò níì gbàsára, òun náà sì le. "
386,She could be rebellious. She knew very well how to show the red eye and laugh people to scorn.,Ó lèbínú tàpa sáṣẹ. Ó mọ bí wọ́n ṣe ń fi ojú pípọ́n hàn kí ó sì fi ẹ̀rín ṣẹ̀sín ènìyàn.
387,"If things continued that way between them, she knew what to do, she was not a fool.","Tí nǹkan bá ń tẹ̀síwájú lọ báyìí láàárín wọn, ó mọ nǹkan tó lè ṣe, kì í kúkú ṣe aṣiwèrè."
388,And Alamu should not blame her for what her own reaction to everything might turn out to be.,Àlàmú kò sì gbọ́dọ̀ dá a lẹ́bi fún ohunkóhun tí yóò jẹ́ àṣẹ̀yìn bọ̀ nǹkan tó ń ṣẹlẹ̀.
389,"At home, Labake was now biding her time, minding her business and making herself happy as much as possible with Tinu and Zenabu.","Nílé, Làbákẹ́ ti wá ń báìgbà yí, ó ń ṣọ́igbá rẹ̀, ó sì ń mú inú ara rẹ̀ dùn pẹ̀lú Tinú àti Sènábù."
390,These were the two people that kept her company each time Alamu sneaked out to enjoy life in town with his secret lover - the lover whose house he was presently furnishing.,Àwọn yìí ni wọ́n ńdúró tìí nígbàkugbà tí Àlàmú  bá ti yọ́ lọ gbádùn ayé níì gboro pẹ̀lú olólùfẹ́ ìkọ̀kọ̀ rẹ̀ – olólùfẹ́ rẹ̀ tí ó ń toléfún  lọ́wọ́.
391,"The fridge, the television and the ceiling fan had gone ahead of him. Next it was probably going to be the turn of the chairs, the gas cooker and all those rugs and carpets...","Ẹ̀rọ amómitutù, amóhùn-máwòrán àti fáànù olókè ti ṣáájú rẹ̀ lọ. Bóyá àwọn àga ni yóò kàn, gáàsì ìdáná ti gbogbo rọ́ọ̀gì àti kápẹ́ẹ̀tì………."
392,"Then one day, she would just discover that Alamu himself had gone never to come back home again!","Tó bá yá lọ́jọ́ kan, á wá ṣàkíyèsí pé Àlàmú  fúnrare ti lọ, tí kò sí ní padà wá mọ́ láé."
393,What was her offence really that Alamu now wanted to dash their association on the rocks?,Kí ni ẹ̀ṣẹ̀ rẹ̀ gan-an tí Àlàmú  fi wá fẹ́ figi gún àjọṣepọ̀ wọn.
394,The termination of any legal union should be backed up with very strong reasons in a court of law otherwise the court would throw out the suit and award heavy costs against the plaintiff.,"Ìfòpinsí ìgbéyàwó lábẹ́ òfin gbọ́dọ̀ ní àtì lẹ́yìn, ìdí abájọ tí ó mún ádóko ní ilẹ́ ẹjọ́, láì jẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀ ilé-ẹjọ́ á sọwọ́ ẹjọ́ náà sílẹ̀, wọ́n á díye lé olùfìsun láti san."
395,"She was, in fact, the one who ought to drag Alamu to court for desertion and double-dealing.",Òun gan an ni óyẹkí ó pé Àlàmú  lẹ́jọ́fún ìkọ̀sílẹ̀ ìtànjẹ.
396,And surely such a case would be easy to win.,"Láìsí àní-àní, irú ẹjọ́ bẹ́ẹ̀ rọrùn láti borí."
397,She wouldn't even need any lawyer to help her prosecute such a case.,Kò níí nílò agbẹjọ́rò kankan láti ro irú ẹjọ́ bẹ́ẹ̀.
398,"She would prove it herself, beyond reasonable doubt and Alamu would be found guilty and reprimanded.","Á fi ìdí rẹ̀ múlè, tí kò sì ní í sí iyè méjì nípa rẹ̀. Àlàmú  yóò sì jẹ̀bi, wọn á sì bá a wí."
399,Was Alamu really packing out on her?,Ṣé Àlàmú  ń kó kúrọ̀ nílé lóòótọ́ ni?
400,That would be very strange - like fiction.,Nǹkan abàmì bí i Ìtàn-Àròsọ.
401,But couldn't he do it?,Ṣùgbọ́n ṣé kò lè ṣe é ni?
402,Do you trust men? How you deceive yourself!,Ṣé ìwọ gbẹ̀rí ọkùnrin jẹ́ ni? O mà ń tan ara rẹ̀!
403,Because there is nothing men would not do out of desperation however eccentric such a thing might be.,Nítorí kò sí nǹkan tí ọkùnrin ò lè ṣe láì nááni nígbà tí nǹkan tó tàsé bá ṣẹlẹ̀.

405,"He would cancel the wedding celebration without an apology to anybody! Men! A man could, after a drinking spree, lie flat in the middle of the road and ask the on-coming vehicle to accelerate and dispatch him quick!","Áwọ́gi lé ayẹyẹ ìgbéyàwó láì jẹ ẹnikẹ́ni lẹ́bẹ̀!

406,"Men Out of desperation, could contract a second legal marriage and keep the first ‘till-death-do-us-part’ still very intact!","Ọkùnrin pẹ̀lú ìdájú, ó lè ṣe àdéhùn ìgbéyàwó olófin kejì, kí ó ṣì wà nínú ìgbéyàwó ""títí-ikú-óò-fi-yàwá” àkọ́kọ́ rè!"
407,He could pack his bag and baggage and steal out of the matrimonial home to sojourn in the secret home of some lover.,Ó lè di ẹrù rẹ̀ kí ó kó kúrò nínú ilé rẹ̀ kí ó lọ ṣe àlejò ní ilé olólùfẹ́ rẹ̀ kan.
408,There was no stopping the man under the grip of desperation.,Kò sí bí ènìyàn ṣe lè dá ọkùnrin tí ò bá náá ní dúró.
409,"Alamu was a man. He could be desperate, although there was no reason on earth why be should be but things could be so unpredictable in this strange, odd world.","Ọkùnrin ni Àlàmú, ó lè dájú, bí ó tilẹ̀ jẹ́ pé kò sí ìdí fún un láti ṣe bẹ́ẹ̀, ṣùgbọ́n nǹkan ò ṣe é gbẹ́kẹ̀lé ní ilé ayé abàmì tí ò gún régé yìí."
410,Labake kept her cool.,Làbákẹ́ sì ń ṣe jẹ́jẹ́.
411,Little Tinu crawled to her and stood up holding her knees for support.,"Tinú kékeré rá lọ sí ọ̀dọ̀ rẹ̀, ó sì dìde di orúnkún ìyá rẹ̀ múfún ìrànlọ́wọ́."

414,"‘Papa-pa-pa-pa', she babbled.","“Bàbá-ba-ba-ba”, ó ń sọ̀rọ̀ wẹ́rẹ́wẹ́rẹ́."
415,"Labake listened amused. It was interesting infact, curious that Tinu's first word on earth would be Papa!","Làbákẹ́ tẹ́tí tìyanu-tìyanu. Kódà, ó dùn mọ́ ọn, ó yàá lẹ́nu pé “bàbá” ni ọ̀rọ̀ àkọ́kọ́ tí Tinú á kọ́kọ́ sọ láyé rẹ̀."
416,"‘Pa-pa-pa-pa... Papa.. Pa-pa-pa,' the little girl screamed again, to Labake's consternation.","“Bà-bá-bà-bá……….bàbá…….bà-bá-bá”, ọmọbìnrin kékeré náà pariwo sí ìpayà Làbákẹ́."
417,"‘Who is your Papa, Tinu?’ Labake queried with her steady gaze, 'Do you know your Papa, Tinu?","“Ta ni bàbá rẹ Tinú?”,  Làbákẹ́ bèèrè pẹ̀lú ìtẹjúmọ́ rẹ̀. “Ǹ jẹ́ o mọ bàbá rẹ, Tinú?,"

419,"So you like your Papa? And you won't say ‘Mama-Ma-ma-ma-Mama! O.K. Tinu, where is your Papa now?","Àṣé o lè ní fẹ̀ẹ́ bàbá rẹ? O ò sì ní pé“màmá-mà-mà-mamàmá”! Ódáa Tinú, bàbá rẹ dà bayìí?"

421,Leaving us alone. What about that? You like it?,Tí ó ń fi wá sílẹ̀. Ìyẹn ńkọ́? O fẹ́ẹbẹ́ẹ̀?
422,Labake saw what seemed to be a change of expression on the innocent face of her daughter.,Làbákẹ́ rí nǹkan tó jọ àyípadà nínú ìwòojú ọmọ rè tí ò mọ̀kan yìí.
423,Tinu had closed her mouth now. She was no longer smiling. No longer babbling,"Tinú ti pa ẹnu rẹ̀ dé bayìí. Kò rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́ mọ́, tí kò sì sọ̀rọ̀ wẹ́rẹ́wẹ́rẹ́ mọ́."

431,Tell your Papa not to be deceived by that woman outside.,Sọfún bàbá rẹ kí ó má jẹ́ kí obìnrin yẹn tàn-án.

435,Tinu screeched with laughter and started crawling away.,"Tinú fẹ̀rín dún, ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si írá lọ."
436,"But then, she stopped abruptly and Looked back at her mother once more - as if to ask When will Papa come back? No one knows. Labake seemed to have replied","Ṣùgbọ́n ó déédé dúró, ó sì wẹ̀yìn wo ìyá rẹ̀ lẹ́ẹ̀kan sí i –bí igbà tó bá fẹ́ bèèrè pé “nígbà wo ni bàbá máa padà dé?” Kò sẹ́ni tó mọ̀.

438,Labake was wrong.,Làbákẹ́ ti ṣì í.
439,"Alamu was, infact, already at the gate blaring the horn of the vehicle and hailing on her from inside the car.","Kódà, Àlàmú ti wà lẹ́nu géètì tí ó ń tẹ fèèrè ọkọ̀ tí ó sì ń ké pè é láti inú ọkọ̀."
440,"""Labake.. Labake.. Excuse me Labake',",“Làbákẹ́…….. Làbákẹ́…….jọ̀wọ́…….. Làbákẹ́”.
441,"It was a Volkswagen Beetle car. By the time Labake came out, the smoke which the car emitted had not properly cleared and it was not immediately possible for her to see who the driver of the jalopy was. After some time. Labake saw that her husband was the man behind the wheels.","Ọkọ̀ ìjàpá bítù ni.

442,"She took a few unsure steps forward, then stopped.","Ó gbé ìgbésẹ̀ díẹ̀ tí kò dájú síwájú, ó sì dúró."
443,Moved a bit then hesitated again. What was Alamu doing inside this strange ramshackle iron cage on four wheels?,"Ó sún síwájú díẹ̀ sí i, ótún dúró wòye. Kí ni Àlàmú  ń ṣe nínú ọkọ̀ dékumágolo jágbajàgba ẹlẹ́sẹ̀ mẹ́rin yìí?"
444,"‘Come now, Labake. It's me.’","“Máa bọ̀,  Làbákẹ́ èmi ni”"

446,Come on Labake. Help give the car a push. A little push.,“Dákun Làbákẹ́. Bá mi ti ọkọ̀ yìí. Tí díẹ̀ ni.
447,It needs some pushing else it won't start.,"Ó nílò títì, bíbẹ́ẹ̀ kò ní dáhùn."
448,Just now it stopped.,Ó ṣè è dákú nísinsìnyìí ni.
449,Maybe something wrong with its contact set.,Bóyá nǹkankan ti ń ṣe kọ́ńtáàti rẹ̀.
450,Or it may be the battery. Alamu's teeth flashed and he filled with laughter.,"Ó sì lè jẹ́ bátììrì. Àlàmú fẹyín, ló bá bú sí ẹ̀rín."
451,Labake stood rooted to the ground undecided what to do. Her jaw dropped.,Làbákẹ́ dúró fẹsẹ̀ múlẹ̀ láì mọ̀ nǹkantí yóò ṣe. Ẹnu rè si yà á.

453,Then you'll just push.,Ìwọ á kàn tì í.
454,Now try it.,Óyá gbìyànjú ẹ̀.
455,A little push’.,Títì díẹ̀.”
456,Labake did not move.,Làbákẹ́ kò mira
457,"Whose car is this Alamu?' she asked, utterly perplexed.","“Ọkọ̀ ta lèyí Àlàmú?”, óbéèrè pẹ̀lú ìrújú pátápátá."
458,"‘Our car. Our new car Labake’ replied Alamu, ‘I should have let you know earlier. But first, do give ...’","“Ọkọ̀ wa. Ọkọ̀ tuntun wa Làbákẹ́”, Àlàmú dáhùn. “Mi ò báti jẹ́ kí o mọ̀ tẹ́lẹ̀. Ṣùgbọ́n kọ́kọ́ bá mi t………….”"
459,"‘New car!’ Labake shouted back, ‘Do you call this a new car? What happened to your Peugeot 504 which you drove out in the morning Alamu?’","“Ọkọ̀ tuntun!”  Làbákẹ́ jágbe mọ́ ọn, “Ìwọ pe èyí ní ọkọtuntun?

460,"‘Well, engine trouble Labake. The mechanic said its general repair would cost some two thousand naira. This is because the whole engine has to be completely overhauled’.","“Ẹẹẹn, wàhálà ẹ́ńjíìnì ọkọ̀ Làbákẹ́.

461,"Labake listened, unbelieving, unconvinced.","Làbákẹ́ tẹ́tí, láì gbàgbọ́, láì gbọ́kàn lé e."
462,"In the morning of that day, she had heard Alamu give the car engine a hard rev. The engine was as active as that of a new car, fresh from the factory.","Ní òwúrò ọjọ́ náà, ó gbọ́ bí Àlàmú ṣe ń tẹná mọ́ ọkọ náà.

463,What then could have gone wrong with the car between the time Alamu left the house in the morning and this afternoon?,Kí ló ti yára ṣe ọkọ̀ láàárín ásìkò tí Àlàmú kúrò nílé láàárọ̀ àti ọ̀sán yìí?
464,"‘And now Alamu, Labake pressed on, ‘Where is the car? Still with the mechanic?’","“Nísinsìnyí Àlàmú”,  Làbákẹ́ tẹ̀síwájú, “Níbo ni ọkọ̀ náà wà, ṣé lọ́dọ̀ mẹkáníìkì?”"
465,"‘Well. No. Not exactly. Well. You see. The question is, where shall we get all that money to repair it, Labake?","“Ẹẹnn. Rárá. Bẹ́ẹ̀ kọ́. Ẹẹn. ṣo rí i. Ibo ni a ti máa rí adúrú owó yẹn láti tún un ṣe?, lo yẹ kí o béère."

467,"‘Beg your pardon Alamu’, Labake could not believe her ears, ‘What is it that you have just said?","“Dúró ná, Àlàmú ”, Làbákẹ́ kò gba etí rẹ̀ gbọ́, “Kí ni mo gbọ́ tó o wí yẹn?"

469,Do you know it would cost a fortune to maintain this one. Labake asked.,Ṣé o ò mọ̀ pé owó iyebíye lo máa run sórí eléyìí láti ṣètọ́jú rẹ̀.” Làbákẹ́ béèrè.
470,"She scrutinised her husband from head to toe, greatly bewildered at his seeming lunacy, What type of man was this? How best was this type of man to be described?","Ó wo ọkọ rẹ̀ láwòfín láti orí dé ẹsẹ̀, ìrújú dé bá a lórí wèrètó ṣẹ̀ ń dé sí i, irú ọkùnrin wo nìyí?

471,"Was this truly her husband? She watched, as if struck by thunder, the spectacle in front of her.","Ṣé ọkọ rẹ̀rè é lóòótọ́? Ó ń wò bíì gbàtí àrá bá sán bá a, ó ń wo idán iwájú rẹ̀."
472,Alamu got down and pushed the Volkswagen car himself using his right hand to turn its steering from outside. The car screeched and wobbled into the car park.,"Àlàmú bọ́ sílẹ̀, ó sì ń ti ọkọ̀ ìjàpá rẹ̀ fún rarẹ̀, ó ń fi ọwọ́ ọ̀tún yí ọwọ́ rẹ̀ láti ìta.

473,The thick smoke which the car discharged when it jerked to a sudden halt a short while ago had completely cleared. The smoke had gone up into the air melting into the clear afternoon sky.,"Eruku kíki tí ọkọ̀ náà tú jáde nígbà tó dúró lójijì láìpẹ́ yìí ti pòórá pátápátá.

475,Labake rushed after him and caught up with him in the sitting room. She grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and shook him roughly.,"Làbákẹ́ kù gìrì tèlé e, ó sì bá a ní yàrá ìgbàlejò. Ó gbá a mú lọ́rùn aṣọ rẹ̀, ó sì mì ín jìgìjìgì."

479,‘Why? why Alamu?’ Labake was confused. She gradually loosened her rough grip and placed her two hands over her husband's shoulders in a manner of surrender.,"“Kílódé?

481,‘Nothing’,“Kò sí nǹkankan”
482,His tone was suspiciously plain: It was unconvincing. Labake was not sure.,Ìṣọwọ́ sọ̀rọ̀ rẹ̀ ní ìgboyà tí ó fu ni lára nínú: kò dánilójú tó. Kò sì dá Làbákẹ́ lójú.

498,Laughing like the hyena and at such odd times is a sure sign of insanity. Watch out. Watch out.,“Rírín ẹ̀rín bí ìkokò ní àsìkò tí kòtọ́ jẹ́ àmì aágànná. Fura o. Fura o.”.

516,The road that led to the hospital was smoothly tarred. The lawns to the left and right of the road well maintained.,"Títì ọlọ́dà tó wà lọ́nà ilé ìwòsàn náà tẹ́jú, ẹ̀gbẹ̀ẹ̀gbẹ́ rẹ̀ lọ́tùn-ún lósì ni wọ́n tọ́jú dáadáa, tó sì mọ́ féfé."
517,"But as the gates swung open on that day, Labake was left in no doubt that she was in the very house of horror.","Ṣùgbọ́n bí wọ́n ṣe ń ṣí géètì lọ́jọ́ náàni Làbákẹ́ ti mọ̀ pé láìsí àní-àní, ilé ẹ̀rù ni òun wọ̀."
518,A middle-aged man stripped himself naked and ran about the hospital premises screeching with laughter.,"Ọkùnrin ọ̀dọ́ kan ni ó já ara rẹ̀ sí ìhòòhò, ó sì ń sá káàkiri ọgbà ilé ìwòsàn  náà pẹ̀lú ẹ̀rín kèé kèé."
519,"The hospital security men pursued him and finally caught up with him, they tried to force some clothes on him to cover his shame.","Àwọn èṣọ́ ọgbà ilé ìwòsàn náà sáré lé e, wọ́n sì rí i mú, wọ́n gbìyànjú láti wọ aṣọfún un tipátipá láti lè bo ẹ̀sín ara rẹ̀."
520,The middle-aged man started laughing uproariously - popping out his head like that of mountain lizard.,"Ọkùnrin náà tún bẹ̀rẹ̀ ẹ̀rín aláriwo, ó sì ń yọ orí sókè bí i ti aláǹgbá orí àpólà."
521,"‘Let me dance. Leave me to dance,’ he screamed. ‘The people are all waiting. Waiting to see me dance.","Ẹ jẹ́ n jó, ẹ fi mí lẹ̀ kí n jó, ó pariwo. “Àwọn ènìyàn ti ń dúró, wọ́n ń dúró láti rí ijó mi."
522,I will dance. And they'll swear they've never seen anybody dance so well before. Leave me! Let me dance for my people! I will dance! He started struggling with the security men.,Màá jó”. Wọ́n á búra pé wọn ò rí́ enìkankan tó jó jù bayì lọ. Ẹ fi mí lẹ̀! Ẹ jẹ́ n jó fún àwọn èyàn mi! Màá jó!

523,"‘You will dance.’ Labake heard one of the security men retort - with a touch of humour, ‘You will dance quite alright man... But don't dance naked... That's what we are saying. Let's dress you up for the great dance! Wait! Wait!’","“Wà á jó.""

524,"The middle-aged man twisted free once more, and broke off.",Arákùnrin ọ̀dọ́ náà lọ́ra lẹ́ẹ̀kan sí ió sì tu dànù.
525,"Before the men knew what was happening, the man, stark naked, was at the hospital gate, wanting to escape - to his dance arena!","Kí àwọn ẹ̀ṣọ́ náà tó mọ ohun tí ó ń ṣẹlẹ̀, Ọkùnrin náà ti wà lẹ́nu géètì ilé ìwòsàn náà ní ìhòòhò ìbíǹbí, ó fẹ́ sá lọ – sí ibi eré ijó rẹ̀!"
526,"Labake had been affected by that incident. She'd never seen anything like that before. Although she'd seen lunatics in strategic places in town - at Mokola centre point, Gege road junction, Dugbe market, Ogunpa motor park and in front of the Scala Cinema.","Ìṣẹ̀lè yìí mú Làbákẹ́ lọ́kàn.

527,"This was the first time she would see one so violent, and go stark-naked, one who spoke fluent English and educated lunatic!","Èyí ni ìgbà àkọ́kọ́ tí ó rí èyí tí ó burú jáì débi jíjá ara rẹ̀ sí ìhòòhò ìbíǹbí, tí èdè Gẹ̀ẹ́sì sì já geere lẹ́nu rẹ̀, wèrè alákọ̀wé."
528,Labake's heart started beating fast.,Ọkàn Làbákẹ́ bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í lù kì-kì-kì .
529,"‘This is a Mental Hospital, Labake, Remi her friend, quietly reminded her, ‘Not just any ordinary hospital. And you have actually not seen anything yet you know. Our world here is a different world.’","“Ilé ìwòsàn tí wọ́n ti ń ṣètọ́ jú àwọn alárùn ọpọlọ rè é Làbákẹ́”, Rẹ̀mí ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ rán an létí níì ṣọ̀rọ̀ kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́. “Kì í ṣe ilé ìwòsàn kan ṣá. O ò sì tíì rín ǹkankan rárá, ayé ọ̀tọ̀ ni a wà níbí́”."
530,"Labake looked strangely at her friend, ‘And these are the type of people you live with  Remi?’","Làbákẹ́ wo ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ ní ìwò tó ṣàjèjì, “Irú àwọn tí ẹ sì ń bá gbé rè é Rẹ̀mí?”"
531,‘Yes Labake. These people need help you know.,“Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni Làbákẹ́. Àwọn ènìyàn yìí nílò ìrànwọ́ ṣé o mọ̀.
532,"And we are really helping them. We are trained to help them. Many of them get better, with time, and we discharge them to live, once more, a happy, normal life.’","A sì ń ràn wọ́n lọ́wọ́ gidi. Wọn kò wá láti ràn wọ́n lọ́wọ́ ni.

533,"Labake's friend, a psychiatric nurse, gave Labake pep talk on signs and symptoms of mental derangement.","Ọ̀rẹ́ Làbákẹ́ nọ́ọ̀sì alárùn ọpọlọ, fún un ní àlàyé ìjìnlẹ̀ lórí àwọn àmì àti àpẹẹrẹ ìdàrúdàpọ̀ ọpọlọ."
534,"At first, the victims would not talk to anybody, they would withdraw into a private world - a world known only to them, that was the period of initiation.","Lákọ̀ọ́kọ́, aláìsàn náà kò ní bá ẹnikẹ́ni sọ̀rọ̀, wọn á kọ́kọ́ yà wọ inú ayé bòókẹ́lẹ́, ayé tí àwọn nìkan mọ̀, ìgbàyẹn ni ásìkò ìgbà-sẹ́gbẹ́ wọn."
535,"After getting properly integrated and assimilated into this strange world, they would, in the next stage begin to talk to the invisible colleagues of their super-sensible world. Laughing with them, sharing jokes with them.","Lẹ́yìn tí wọ́n bá ti darapọ̀ mọ́ ayé abàmì náà, wọn á bẹ̀rẹ̀ ipele mìíràn tí wọn á ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ si íbá àwọn ẹgbẹ́ àìrí wọn sọ̀rọ̀ nínú ayé àwọn alánìíjùọpọlọ. Wọn á sì máa bá wọn rẹ́rìn-ín, wọn á dọ́wẹ̀ẹ́kẹ̀ pẹ̀lú wọn."
536,"Later on, in another stage, the third stage, they would grow wild with the earthly men and women who would want to disturb them, who would not allow them to enjoy their new-found freedom.","Lẹ́yìn èyí, ní ipele mìíràn tí ó jẹ́ ipele kẹ́ta ni wọ́n á ti di ẹhà nnà, pẹ̀lú àwọn ará ayé lọ́kùnrin lóbìnrin tí á fẹ́ dàwọ́n láàmú, tí ò ní jẹ́ kí wọ́n gbádùn òmìnira tuntun yìí."
537,"This was the violent stage and here the lunatics would freely use stones, cudgels and their sharp teeth to attack and wound innocent people...","Èyí ni ipele ìjàkadì níbi tí àwọn aláìsàn yìí á ti máa lo òkò, igi àti eyín mímú wọn láti fi dojúkọ àwọn aláìṣẹ, tí wọn á ṣe wọ́n léṣe."
538,"‘These are the various signs and symptoms, Nurse Remi summed up. All these symptoms are present in the various types of mental patients. There are, for instance, the maniac proper ones, the maniac depressives, and the schizophrenics.","“Èyí ni àwọn àmì àti àpẹẹrẹ oríṣìíríṣìí”, Nọ́ọ̀sì Rẹ̀mí kádìí ọ̀rọ̀ rẹ̀ nílẹ̀.

539,Labake looked lost. Her friend was now peaking far above her. With bated breath she'd listened.,Làbákẹ́ dàbí i ẹni tí ó sọnù. Ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ ti sọ̀rọ̀ jìnnà jìnnà síbi tó wà. Pẹ̀lú ẹ̀mí ìbẹ̀rù ni ó fi ń tẹ́tí.
540,"That incident at the Mental Hospital now came to her, striking her more forceful than ever before - because of its relevance to the present situation. And she started breathing heavily.","Ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ ilé ìwòsàn alárùn ọpọlọ yẹn tún wá sí ilórí, tí ó wá rántí tipá tipá ju ti tẹ́lẹ̀ lọ - nítorí ìjọra tí ó wà láàárín rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú nǹkan tó ń ṣẹlẹ̀ sí i lọ́wọ́ lọ́wọ́. Ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í mí lókèlókè."
541,The lunatic Labake saw at the Mental Hospital was of Alamu's age- group.,Wèrè tí Làbákẹ́ rí ní ilé ìwòsàn lọ́jọ́ náà kò lè ju ọjọ́ orí Àlàmú  lọ.
542,He was tall and dark complexion - just like Alamu! Like Alamu he spoke impeccable English.,"Ó dúdú, ó sì ga –bí i ti Àlàmú! Ó ń sọ èdè Gẹ̀ẹ́sì tó yan-ran-n-tí lẹ́nu, bí iti Àlàmú."
543,People said the man spent many years studying in the country of the white man.,Àwọn ènìyàn sọ pé ọkùnrin náà ti lo àìmọye ọdún nílùú òyìnbó láti kẹ́kọ̀ọ́.
544,They said he got his mental trouble shortly after he came back to the country. What a strangely unhappy coincidence!,Wọ́n ní ó rí wàhálà àrùn ọpọlọ rẹ̀ ní kété tó dé sí ilé. Irú ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ aburú wo rè é!
545,"Labake reflected again, soberly, over those signs and symptoms her friend described to her.","Làbákẹ́ tún rántí, tìrẹ̀lẹ̀, gbogbo àwọn àmì àti àpẹẹrẹ tí ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ júwèé fún un."
546,"The patient at home was already in that second stage. As she rolled on the bed inside her room, she prayed with hot tears in her eyes that the violent third stage might be avoided for Alamu at all costs.","Aláìsàn tí ó wà nílé ti wà ní ipele kejì yẹn. Bí ó ṣe ń yí lórí ìbùsùn inú yàrá rẹ̀, ó ń gbàdúrà pẹ̀lú omijé gbígbóná pékì ipele kẹ́ta má dé bá Àlàmú ní gbogbo ọ̀nà."
547,And that would probably mean taking him to the white-washed solitary building on top of the hill for an urgent treatment.,Nítorí ìyẹn á fa kí wọ́n mú u lọ sí ilé ọlọ́dà funfun lórí òkè fún ìtọ́jú kíákíá.
548,The lapse of time is capable of working wonders on both the mental and the physical being of anyone: Especially a time-lapse that has been loaded with plenty of problems.,Àsìkò lágbára láti dárà lórí ìrísí àti ìròrí ẹnikẹ́ni: Pàápàá jùlọ àsìkò tí ó kún fún ọ̀pọ̀lọpọ̀ ìsòro.
549,"In the case of Alamu, the trouble-infested time-lapse did not spare his mind and his body.","Ní ti Àlàmú, àsìkò tí ó kún fún ìṣòro yìí kò fi ẹ̀mí àti ara rẹ̀ sílẹ̀."
550,"Within a short span of five months, his skin had become so saggy and so battered that he now looked far older than his age. Days kept ticking like the minute-hand of the clock - all along taking a heavy toll on him.","Láà̀árín àsìkò tí ò pọ̀, oṣù márùn-ún, awọ̀ ara rẹ̀ ti kú, o sì ti bajẹ́ tí ó fi jẹ́ ó dàbí i ẹni tí ó ti dàgbà ju ọjọ́ orí rẹ̀̀ lọ. Ọjọ́ ń yí lọ bí ọwọ aago, wọ́n sì ń darà fún  un."
551,His moustache had become overgrown. The hair stood straight and long over his upper lip - like the uncultivated bush of virgin land.,"Irunmú rẹ̀ ti kún àkúnju. Irun ibẹ̀ dúró sọọrọ, ó sì gùn kọjá ètè òkè rẹ̀ bí igbó ilẹ̀ tí wọn kò ì tì dáko lorí rẹ̀ rí."
552,"An almost impenetrable forest of hair had grown on his head, making the head heavy and dense.","Igbó irun kìjikìji tí ò ṣe é wọ̀ ni ó ti hù lorí rẹ̀, tí ó ń jẹ́ kí olórí sì jọ ọ̀dẹ̀."
553,"In the mornings, he would run the comb through the wiry kinks with some effort and his brow would tense up and knit in several wrinkles.","Láràárọ̀, á ti ìyarun bọ igbó kìjikìji orí rẹ̀ pẹ̀lu ìgbìyànjú díẹ̀, òkè ojú rẹ̀ á sì hun jọ."
554,He had on two or three occasions seen tears gathering in his own eyes as the long comb harrowed painfully across the overgrown bush on his head.,Bí ẹ̀ẹ̀mejì sí ẹ̀ẹ̀mẹ́ta ni omi ojú ṣara jọ sí ojú rẹ̀ bí ìyarun gígùn  náà ṣe ń kọjá nínú igbó àkúnjù tó wà lórí rẹ̀̀.
555,"At times. he would avoid, completely, the use of the comb. Just press down the mass of hair with his palm several times, then furry out of the house before Labake would start protesting against 'unkempt hair', scruffy appearance, and the like.","Nígbà mìíràn, kì í lo ìyarun rárá. Á kàn fọwọ́ tẹ igbo irun rẹ̀ mọ́lẹ̀ pẹ̀lú àtẹlẹwọ́, á wá tètè kúrò nínú ilé kí Làbákẹ́ tó máa polongo tako ìmúra rẹ̀ bí i irun tí kò túnṣe, ìrísí tí kò mọ́ tó àti bẹ́ẹ̀ bẹ́ẹ̀ lọ̣."
556,"But now, as he gazed in the mirror, he saw the need for him to be a little more careful with his own appearance.","Ṣùgbọ́n nísinsìnyí, bí ó ṣe ń wo inú dígí, ó rí i pé òun ní láti ṣọ́ra diè sí i nípa ìrísí òun."
557,"A look of deprivation was visible on the face that gazed back at him from inside the mirror. Worriedly, his eyeballs rotated inside the sockets.","Ìwò ẹni tí ìyà jẹ hàn lójú rẹ̀ bí ó ṣe ń wo ara rẹ̀ nínú dígí. Pẹ̀lú àìbalẹ̀ àyà, ẹyin ojú rẹ̀ yípo nínú àkọ̀ rẹ̀̀."
558,"His cheeks had sunk deep. What Alamu saw inside the mirror, actually, was nothing but a caricature of his own former self.",Ẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ rẹ̀ sì ti pa pó. Ohun tí Àlàmú rí nínú dígí kìí ṣe ohunkóhun bí ko ṣe òjìjí ara rẹ̀ tẹ́lẹ̀ rí.
559,"No wonder people always gazed at him curiously, suspiciously. He remembered the inquisitorial gaze people gave him, as he got down from his Volkswagen, walked across the street, and entered the bank the other day.","Abájọ tí àwọn ènìyàn fi máa ń wò ó tìyanu-tìyanu, tìfuta-tìfura. Ó rántí ìwò ìbéèrè tí àwọn ènìyàn wò ó, nígbà tó bọ́lẹ̀ nínú ọkọ̀ Volkswagen  rẹ̀, tí ó sì rìn òpópónà kọjá, tí ó lọ sí ilé ìfowópamọ́ sí lọ́jọ́ yẹn."
560,They turned their heads several times looking back at him and muttering - and he began to wonder what the problem was.,Wọ́n ń yírí wẹ̀yìn ní àìmọye ìgbà tí wọ́n ń wò ó tí wọ́n sì ń kùn - ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í wò pé kí ló fà á.
561,"He remembered being gazed at that way only  when he first arrived in England. In the streets of London, at the shopping centres and in the University Campus, stiff-necked, umbrella-swinging men and women eyed him from the comers of theirs eyes, winked and hissed at him.","Ó rántí pé wọ́n wo òun bẹ́ẹ̀ nígbà ti òun kọ́kọ́ déìlú òyìnbó.

562,"Briskly, the people brushed past him without returning his greetings. And whenever he ventured a discussion, they turned strangely from him and moved away as if they'd encountered a human being who had just descended on their part of the earth from another planet!","Kíákíá, àwọn ènìyàn ń kọjá lára rẹ̀ láì dáhùn sí kíkí rẹ̀.

563,"At times, when he pinned them to a tight comer and threw some friendly questions at them, they answered him with an absent-minded ‘yes... yes... yes’ followed by some kind of mischievous chuckle that often made him look stupid.","Nígbà mìíràn, tó bá káwọn mọ́ kọ̀rọ̀ kan, tí ó sì bèèrè ìbéèrè lọ́wọ́ wọn pẹ̀lú òyàyà, wọn á dá a lóhùn láì fọkàn sí i “bẹ́ẹ̀ ni……bẹ́ẹ̀  ni…….bẹ́ẹ̀  ni”, ni wọ́n á fi dáhùn, tíwọn á sì rìn bí adìẹ, tí èyí sì máa ń jẹ́ kí ó jọ òmùgò."
564,"It was after some time that he got to know that the matter really was his peculiar accent; his bearing; his general comportment. It did not take him long, however, to readjust, and very soon, he became a free-mixer with lots and lots of friends among the white people.","Lẹ́yìn ìgbà díẹ̀, ni ó tó mọ̀ pé ìṣọwọ́ sọ̀rọ̀ rẹ̀ , ìrìnsí àti ìhùwàsí rẹ̀ ni ó fà á.

565,"Here he was now, at home, going through a similar experience among his own people. But now, for a different reason.","Ótún wà nílé báyìí, ó sì ń la irú nǹkan yìí kọjá láàárín àwọn ènìyàn tirẹ̀. ṣùgbọ́n nísinsìnyí, fún ìdímìíràn ni."
566,"They gazed curiously at him. The gaze literally stripped him naked, and pierced him like a poisoned arrow would pierce the human skin.","Wọ́n ń wò ó tìyanu-tìyanu. Wíwò wọn ń faṣọ ya mọ́ ọn lára, ó sì ń gún un bí ìgbà tí ọfà bá wọ ara ènìyàn."
567,He was at the bank that day to collect his statement of account. He made a deposit some time after he sold his car. He now wanted to know the true position of the account.,Ó wásí ilé ìfowópamọ́ sí lọ́jọ́ náà láti gba ìwé ìṣirò owó rẹ̀. Ó tọ́ju owó ní kété tó ta mọ́tò rẹ̀. Ó wá fẹ́ mọ pàtó iye owó tó wà lórúkọ rẹ̀.
568,"As he took his seat on the sofa, waiting to be attended to, he decided he would just ignore the harassing look of the people.","Bí ó ṣe ń jókòó sórí àga tìmùtìmù tí ó ń dúró de ẹni tó máa dá a lóhùn, ó pinnu láti fojú pa àwọn ìwò burúkú tí àwọn ènìyàn ń wò ó rẹ́."
569,"They had come to transact business. He too had come to transact business. No more, no less.",Òwò ni wọ́n bá wá. Òun náà sìbá òwò wá.
570,Everybody must mind their own business. Directly opposite him were the bank officials. First cashier - current second cashier - savings; the ledger man; and the account clerks.,"Kí oníkálukú kọju mọ́ ohun tó bá wá.

571,Sitting inside the inner apartment were the Accountant and the Bank Manager and their two typists.,Àwọn tí wọ́n jókòó nínú lóhùn-ún ni àwọn oníṣirò àti alábojútó ilé ìfowópamọ́sí náà àti àwọn atẹ̀wéwọn méjì.
572,"Alamu avoided the Accountant and the Manager. He was quite familiar with them, but this time around, he was in no mood to exchange pleasantries.","Àlàmú yẹra fún oníṣirò àti alábojútó ilé ìfowópamọ́sí náà.

573,"They might in the process, start asking him questions about this, about that... questions, for instance, about his place of work and the latest development there.","Wọ́n lè máa fìyẹn bí í ní àwọn ìbéèrè oríṣìírísìí, fún àpẹẹrẹ iṣẹ́ rẹ̀ àti ìlọsíwájú tuntun níbẹ̀."
574,"These are questions he would not want to answer. He was in the bank only for a slight business, and would want to get out of the place as quickly as he could make it.","Kò sì ní fẹ́dáhùn sí irú àwọn ìbéèrè wọ̀nyí.

575,"His attention was directed to the cashier current, who had in front of him a huge pile of new currency notes.","Ojú rẹ̀ lọ sí ọ̀dọ̀ olùtọ́jú owó kìíní, tí ó ní òkìtì owótúntún ńlá níwájú rẹ̀."

580,"That was a pretty big sum enough money to build a decent well furnished mansion, buy a three-seater Mercedes Benz, set up a large business and feed a family of three for a period of ten years.","Owó ńlá gbáà ni èyí, ó tó kọ́ ilé ńlá tí a ṣe lọ́ṣọ̀ọ́ gidi, á ra ọkọ̀ mẹ̀sí ọlọ́yẹ́ oníjokòó mẹ́ta, á wá bẹ̀rẹ̀ òwòńlá, á sì bọ́ ẹbí eléèyàn mẹ́ta fún  odidi ọdún mẹ́wàá gbáko."
581,"Alamu's eyes kept turning to the direction of cashier number one, and to that huge pile in front of him. Would this cashier call his tally number and invite him to come and carry the pile away!.","Ojú Àlàmú kò kúrò ní apá ọ̀dọ̀ olùtọ́jú owó kìíníyìí, àti òkìtì owó tó wà níwájú rẹ̀. ṣé olùtọ́jú owóyìí á  pè é pé kí ó máa gbé òkìtì owó náà lọ!"
582,That would have been the end of his troubles.,Ìyẹn ò bá tán gbogbo wàhálà rẹ̀.
583,"All his problems would have disappeared there and then. He would have walked into his place of work at Bajoks Company Limited, the following morning and flung his resignation letter in the face of the Personnel Manager of the company, cursing him, swearing oaths at him for all his wickedness and handedness.","Gbogbo ìṣòro rẹ̀ ò bá parẹ lójú ẹsẹ̀.

584,"He would have been spared, once and all the ordeal of anonymous petitions, stupid queries and master-minded enquiries and probes, all of which were attached to the big job of an Accountant, but now, he was neck-deep in all this official mess.","Kò bá ti bọ́ lẹ́ẹ̀kan lọ́wọ́ gbogbo ìpèlẹ́jọ́ àìmọ̀dí, lẹ́tà ṣàlàyé ara rẹ àti ọ̀fin tótó olùfisùn àti àwọn ìwádìí tí ó so mọ́ iṣẹ́ oníṣirò, ṣùgbọ́n nísinsìnyí, gbogbo wàhálà yìí ti wọ̀ ọ́ lọ́rùn."

587,"Alamu watched as the fat-necked, pot-bellied rich men of the city hurried in and out of the bank carrying executive handbags packed full with currency notes. And he bit his lips.","Àlàmú ń wo bí àwọn olówó ìlú, ọlọ́rùn kíki àti àwọn oníkùn agbè ṣe ń wọlé-jáde nínú ilé ìfowópamọ́ sí pẹ̀lú àwọn bàágí ìfàlọ́wọ́ ńlá tí ó kún fún owó kọ̀rẹ́ńsì.

595,"One's purpose of education had been defeated! If one would burn the midnight oil and face the wrath of the terrible winter in the white man's land for donkey years, and still come back home to suffer and suffer then book work was sheer waste of time, a real waste of energy.","Wọ́n ti borí ìdífún ìwé kíkà, bí ènìyàn bá jó epo àtùpà òru, tí ó sì fojú winá òtútù burúkú nílẹ̀ aláwọ̀funfunfún àìmọye ọdún, tí ó tún padà wálé wá jìyà –ìfàsìkò ṣòfò gbáà ni ìwé kíkà jẹ́ nígbà yẹn, ìfokun ṣòfò gbáà ni."
596,"The Accounts Clerk beckoned on Alamu, stretched out his hands and handed over to him the small slip inside which he inscribed the balance of his account.","Akọ̀wé ìṣirò owó ti pe Àlàmú , ó sì na wọ́ ìwé pélébé tí ó kọ owó tí ó ṣẹ́kù fún un sí."
597,It was a debit balance of seventy naira! Alamu's head turned round and round.,Ó jẹ gbèsè àádọ́run náírà! Orí Àlàmú  yípo yípo.
598,"He started back-pedalling, feeling his way out of the bank with clumsy, unmeasured footsteps. But, momentarily, he hesitated in front of Cashier Number One and saw that those huge piles of new naira notes were still standing, yet unclaimed. But they were not for him! And he bit his lips.","Ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í fẹ̀yìn rìn padà, lọ sí ọ̀nà ìta pẹ̀lú ìrìn ẹsẹ̀ lílọ́, tí kò wo ibi tí ó ń lọ. ṣùgbón, ó bá ara rẹ̀ níwájú olùtọ́jú owó àkọ́kọ́, ó sìrí ipé òkìtì owó náà kò tí ì kúrò níbẹ̀, wọn kò sì rẹ́ni gbàá.

599,The bank security man - an ex-servicemen of World War Two fame moved closer to Alamu with a questioning look and escorted him out with some disparaging remarks which he muttered under his breath.,"Ẹ̀ṣọ́ ilé Ìfowópamọ́sí náà tí ó jẹ́ ajagun fẹ̀yìntì nínú ogun àgbáyé kejì súnmọ́ Àlàmú pẹ̀lú ìwò tó ń ṣè béèrè, ó sìn-ín jáde pẹ̀lú ọ̀rọ̀ àbùkù."
600,He was newly-appointed as the bank's security man and had apparently not met Alamu before.,"Wọ́n ṣẹ̀ṣẹ̀ gba ẹ̀ṣọ́ yìí siṣẹ́ ní ilé ìfowópamọ́ sí yìí ni, kò sì tí ì bá Àlàmú pàdé rí."
601,"The security man tapped his fingers three times. He observed that people had started looking at him, taking interest in what he was doing. He was glad to be so noticed to be seen doing his job. performing his duty.","Ẹ̀ẹ̀mẹ́ tani ẹ̀ṣọ́ náà tàka.

604,"He started his car engine and drove like a possessed man through the city's streets, meandering around the  blind corners dangerously. A lurid glow of smoke from the car’s silencer chased after him .","Ó ṣáná sọ́kọ̀ rẹ̀, ó sì wà ábí ẹni táyé ń ṣe ni àwọn òpópónà ìlú, tí ó sì ń wa ìwàkuwà ní àwọn ọ̀nà kọ̀rọ̀ ìlú torótoró.

605,That was a day Alamu would never forget...,Ọjọ́ mánigbàgbé ni ọjọ́ yìí jẹ́fún Àlàmú…
606,"Now as he looked at himself in the mirror inside the sitting room, he seemed to understand the day he visited the bank reason for the curious looks from people the other his appearance, his ble appearance! He shook his head sadly out of pity for the battered figure that gazed back at him from inside the mirror - his own figure.","Nísinsìnyí, bí ó ṣe ń wo ara rẹ̀ nínú dígí ní ìyàrá àlejò, òye ìwò ìyanu tí àwọn ènìyàn ń wò ó lọ́jọ́ tí ó lọsí ilé ifowópamọ́sí yé e.

607,"Alamu knew that as long as he left his hair, moustache and beard shaved, people would continue taking him for the eccentric bar-beach prophet preaching salvation, calling sinners to repentance, for the crazy road-side magician shouting abracadabra performing wonders with his wand... Or - God forbid!, for a mental patient, fresh from his escape from the herbalist's lunatic asylum!","Àlàmú mọ̀ pé níwọ̀nìgbà tí òun bá ti fi irun orí, irunmú àti irùngbọ̀n rẹ̀ sílẹ̀ láìfá, àwọn ènìyàn á máa fi òun pe wèrè wòlíì etí òkun tí ó ń wàásù ìgbàlà fún àwọn ẹlẹ́ṣẹ̀, tàbí wèrè onídán lẹ́gbẹ̀ẹ́títì tí ó ń pidán pẹ̀lú ọ̀pá ìpidán rẹ̀…. tàbí ….Ọlọ́run májẹ̀ẹ́!

608,"That was why Alamu's mother seeing him now, hesitated when she entered the house. She was in town on a casual visit to Alamu. There used to be no ceremony about Mama's visit.",Èyí ló fà á tí ìyá Àlàmú fi yarí nígbà tó wọ inú ilé. Ìyá náà wá síì gboro láti wá bẹ Àlàmú  wò láì rò tẹ́lè.

609,"The old woman would just come into the house unannounced and at a time most convenient to her. Most of the time, however, she often felt satisfied with occasional messages from her son, and would not trouble herself coming to town, That was the reason she'd kept off for such a long time...","Ìyá àgbàlagbà náà á kàn wọ inú ilé wá láìsọ tẹ́lẹ̀ lásìkò tó bá wù ú.

610,The last time she came to town was Tinu's naming ceremony. She spent five days. Five hectic days.,Ìgbà ìkómọjáde Tinú ni ó ti wá sígboro kẹ́yìn. Ó lo ọ́jọ́ márùn-ún. Ọjọ́ márùn-ún gbáko pẹ̀lú iṣẹ́ àṣelàágùn.
611,"Mama and Labake never saw eye all through. Labake would not allow Mama to feed the new baby, the traditional way. Mama was always contesting that, letting Labake know that she fed her husband that way.","Làbákẹ́ àti màmá kò ríra lójúkojú fún gbogbo àsìkò náà.

615,"And at the end of the fifth day, Mama left for home in annoyance.","Lẹ́yìn ọjọ́ karùn-ún, Màmá bínú lọ ilé."
616,"Here was Mama again on yet another visit. But this time, she was visiting her son for a purpose - a different purpose.","Màmá lótún dé báyìí, fún ìbẹ̀wò mìíràn lọ́tẹ̀ yìí. Ó wá bẹ ọmọ rẹ̀ wò fún ìdí kan ni, ìdí tó yàtọ̀."

619,That was what the old woman always liked. She cherished the customs of her people so much and always wanted her child to respect the customs too - no matter his position or station in life....,"Nǹkan tí ìyá àgbà náà máa ń ní fẹ̀ẹ́ sí rè é.

622,"But ever since his return, his spinal cord together with its muscles had been so reconditioned and now he could prostrate with some ease. Old Mama would want nothing short of it from her only child. Alamu knew this.",Ṣùgbọ́n láti ìgbà tó ti dé ni egungun ẹ̀yìn rẹ̀ ti padà sípò tí ó sì ti lè dọ̀bálẹ̀ pẹ̀lú ìrọ̀rùn.

631,"Her fears had now been confirmed. She'd got a hint of what she would meet in town ever before she left the village. What she felt in the village was a sudden twitch on the nipples of her wrinkled breasts. She felt the twitch for upwards of one week - and she knew something unusual was going to happen, or had been happening to her son in town.",Ìbẹ̀rù rẹ̀ ṣẹ̀ṣẹ̀ wá fẹsẹ̀ múlẹ̀.

632,"That was the way she felt on the two previous occasions when Alamu had motor accidents on the Lagos - Ibadan Express Way. Her old breasts twitched, threatened to send out milk! Alamu was her only child who sucked those breasts. And God had given her a gift of telepathy with her son through those saggy breasts of hers.","Bí ó ṣe ṣe é rè é níì gbàméjì ọ̀tọ̀ọ̀tọ̀ tí Àlàmú ní ìjàm̀bá ọkọ̀ ní òpópónà márosẹ̀ Èkó sí Ìbàdàn.

635,"A mysterious bond, passing all understanding.","Okùn tó jinlẹ̀, tó ju gbogbo òye lọ."
636,"Some mothers had the gift of telepathy through dreams, others through the enigmatic imaginative power of hallucination. Other true mothers would get messages through signs - signs such as the sudden rumbling of the womb inside which they carried their babies for nine months, or such as the quick jerk of the bone of the back over which their babies crawled during infancy.","Ẹ̀bùn ìfura sọ́rọ̀ ọmọ àwọn ìyá mìíràn ni àlá, àwọn mìíràn níagbára àti rí nǹkan.

637,It was the twitching of the breasts in the case of Alamu's mother.,Jíjá-pà tì ọmú ni ti ìyá Àlàmú.
638,"And when, back in the village, Mama's breasts started twitching ceaselessly for seven whole days, she in apprehension, started packing her buba and iro and a few other necessary items inside the basket in preparation for a visit to her son in town.","Nígbà náà, tí màmá wà lábúlé, ọmú Màmá ń já-pàtìlá ìdáwọ́dúró fún odidi ọjọ́ méje, pẹ̀lú ìbẹ̀rù ni ó fi bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í dí àwọn ìró àti bùbá rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú àwọn ohun èèlòmìíràn tí yóò nílò sínú apẹ̀rẹ̀ níì gbàradì láti lọ bẹ ọmọ rẹ̀ wò ní ìgboro."
639,It was a long time since she last saw him - now going to a year - and this present lean and gaunt appearance sent instant tears dropping down her wrinkled cheeks.,"Ó ti ṣe díẹ̀ tí ó ti rí i – ó ti fẹ́rẹ̀ ẹ́ pé ọdún kan, rírù àti gbígbẹ tí ó rí nínú ìrísí Àlàmú yìí sì jẹ́ kí omijé bọ́ lójú rẹ̀ wàrà-wàrà ní ẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ rẹ̀ tó ti hun jo."

642,"Alamu opened his mouth wide and started his usual strange loud laughter, It lasted for almost two minutes... non-stop.","Àlàmú la ẹnu rẹ̀ gbàgà, ó sì bú sí ẹ̀rín aláriwo abàmì tí ó máa ń rín. Ó rín in fún ìsẹ́jú méjì… láìdúró."

645,"Alamu's mother crashed to the floor, and burst into a body-racking sob! It was convulsive. It was prolonged. She did not recover from the shock until after some five minutes. When at last she regained consciousness, it was still with the ‘why-why-why.. what what-what. and how-how-how’ questions on her lips.","Ìyá Àlàmú wó lulẹ̀, ó sì bú sẹ́kún gidi!

646,"All through the night of that day, Mama's eyes did not close.","Ní gbogbo òru ọjọ́ náà, màmá ò pajú dé."
647,She engaged her son in conversation for most of the time.,Ẹjọ́ ló ń bá ọmọ rẹ̀ rò ní ọ̀pọ̀ ìgbà.
648,"She asked him questions concerning his food; his manner of feeding; the type of friends he kept; where he slept at night, the way he slept, the attitude of the neighbours to him and most importantly, his relationship with Labake at home.","Ó bèèrè nípa oúnjẹ rẹ̀; ìṣọwọ́ jẹun rẹ̀, irú àwọn ọ̀rẹ́ tí ó ń kó, ibi tí ó ń sùn sí lálẹ́; bí ó ṣe ń sùn; ìṣesí àwọn ará àdúgbòsí i; àti pàápàá jùlọ, Ìbáṣepọ̀ rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú Làbákẹ́ nílé."
649,Alamu's answers were not direct.,Àwọn ìdáhùn Àlàmú kò lọ tààrà.
650,Just a word or at best a phrase.,Bí ọ̀rọ̀ kan tàbí àpólà gbólóhùn.
651,He gave them in a manner indicating that he was with Mama only in body.,Ó ńdáhùn pẹ̀lú ìfihàn pé òun wà pẹ̀lú màmá ní tara nìkan.
652,"But all through their discussion one thing Alamu did not forget to say was: ‘No problem Mama... No problem at all,’ He said it several times to his mother ending usually with a loud nervous laughter that left Mama in no doubt that there really was a problem. a big problem.","Ṣùgbọ́n nínú gbogbo ọ̀rọ̀ wọn, ohun kan tí Àlàmú ò gbàgbé láti sọ ni pé “Kò sí ìṣòro màmá… Kò síì ṣòro rárá”.

653,"Was this haggard-looking, laughing buffoon really her own son? Her own loving son whom she carried inside her womb for nine months and on her back all through his infancy?","Ṣé èyí tó rí jálajàla, tí ó ńrẹ́rìn-ín wèrè yìí ni ọmọ òun ?

654,Was this the child sucked her breasts for three years and over whom she had countless sleepless nights? Had her only son now gone mad? Was this the reason why her breasts twitched and twitched for seven days. twitching because Alamu had started to turn his head?,"Ṣé ọmọ tó mu ọmú àyà rẹ̀ fún ọdún mẹ́ta tí kò fi lójú oorun alẹ́ láì mọye ìgbà rè é?

655,"Enemies!... Enemies!... The evil machinations the enemies had started manifesting itself. Mama had been told many years ago, that Alamu's trouble would start as soon as he returned from the white man's country.","Ọ̀tá!… ọ̀tá!......Èròńgbà ibi àwọn ọ̀tá ti ń fara hàn.

656,"That was why Mama did everything possible, originally, to stop her son from going abroad.",Ìdí nìyí tí màmá fi gbogbo ipá rẹ̀ láti má jẹ́kí Àlàmú lọ sí òkè-òkun.
657,The medicine man spoke of her son's enemies. It was her son's destiny to have several enemies. The type of head he brought to the world was the head other people would envy; a brilliant head with a superior brain.,"Bàbá oníṣẹ́gun náà ti sọ nípa àwọn ọ̀tá ọmọ rẹ̀.

658,The type of head many people would want for their children.,Irú orí tí òpọ̀lọpọ̀ ènìyàn ń wáfún ọmọ wọn.
659,"Naturally, therefore, Alamu was going to be the target of envy. His enemies, according to the medicine man, were not going to be in any hurry.","Fún ìdí èyí, dandan ni kí wọ́n jowú ẹ̀. Gẹ́gẹ́ bí oníṣẹ́gun náà ṣe sọ, àwọn ọ̀tá rẹ̀ kò ní kánjú."
660,They would be waiting to deal with him at the peak of his success in life. They would strike during that crucial time and bring him down using somebody very close to him.,"Wọn á máa dúró láti dá sẹ̀ríà fún un bí ó bá ti dé ṣóńṣó àṣeyọrí ní ayé rẹ̀.

661,"Mama was experienced enough to recognise the diabolical power of the enemies, she knew that the enemies could operate from without and from within.","Màmá ní ìrírí tí ó tó láti lè dá ọwọ́ agbára àwọn ọ̀tá mọ̀, ó mọ̀ pé àwọn ọ̀tá lè ṣiṣẹ́ láti ìta àti lábẹ́lé."
662,"She knew again that, by all sorts of tricks and insinuations, enemies could set son, mother and father against one another, they could lead daughter and parents to pitch battle and rum good friends bitter enemies; they could make wife and husband sit on each other's neck and smiling, lead each other to the gates of hell!","Ótún mọ̀ pé pẹ̀lú ọgbọ́n àrékérekè oríṣìíríṣìí àti èròńgbà ni àwọn ọ̀tá lè fi mú ọmọkùnrin pẹ̀lú ìyá àti bàbá rẹ̀ kọlu ara wọn, wọ́n sì lè mú ọmọbìnrin àti àwọn òbí rẹ̀ bẹ̀rẹ̀ ìjà kí wọn ó sì yí ọ̀rẹ́ dáadáa padà sí ọ̀tá búburú; wọ́n lè mú ọkọ àti ìyáwó jókòó lé ara wọn lọ́rùn kí wọn sì máa bá ara wọn fẹyín, kí wọ́n sì darí ara wọn sí ibodè ọ̀run àpáàdì!"
663,Mama reflected and stretched her imagination...,"Màmá ronú jinlẹ̀, ó rò ó sọ́tùn-ún sósì…"
664,"If there was somebody very close to Alamu, that fellow was Labake. They often slept together and ate from the same plate.",Bí ẹnikẹ́ni bá wà tó súnmọ́ Àlàmú bí iṣan-ọrùn ẹ̀dá náà kò lè ṣẹ̀yìn Làbákẹ́.

665,They always clung to each other like yam tendrils.,Wọ́n máa ń lẹ̀ típẹ́ típẹ́ mọ́ ara wọn bí ìtàkùn iṣu.
666,It could as well be the enemies were going to use Labake as an instrument for Alamu's destruction.,Ó lè jẹ́ pé àwọn ọ̀tá fẹ́ lo  Làbákẹ́ gẹ́gẹ́ bí ohun èèlò fún ìparun Àlàmú.
667,"Mama got confirmation of this on the second day... thanks to the free mind and the innocent nature of Zenabu, the house maid. Zenabu had been watching the situation at home with suppressed anxiety and fear, not knowing who to tell it to, or how to tell it.","Màmá fi ìdí èyí mụ́lẹ̀ lọ́jọ́ kejì……….ọpẹ́lọpẹ́ẹ ìwà ìtúnúká àti àìlẹ́bi tí a dá mọ́ Sènábù, ọmọ ọ̀dọ̀ wọn.

668,"But now she found in old Mama a confidant, with whom she could operate on the same level and, accordingly. Zenabu let loose her tongue to Mama.","Ṣùgbọ́n ní báyìí, ó rí màmá gẹ́gẹ́ bí olùfọkàntán tí ó lè bá sowọ́ pọ̀ ní ipele kan náà. Nítorí náà ó lanu sọ ọ́ fún Màmá."
669,She'd caught her madam several times joining her mouth with that of master - both in broad day-light and at night inside their dimly-lit room as she peeped through the key hole...,Ó ti ká mà dáámú lọ́pọ̀lọpọ̀ ìgbà tí ó ń so ẹnu rẹ̀ pọ̀ mọ́ ti ọ̀gá ní ojúmọmọ àti lóru nínú yàrá wọn tí wọ́n tan iná tó pòkudu síbí ó ṣe ń yọjú láti ibi ihò kọ́kọ́rọ́.
670,"In that position, according to Zenabu, her madam was always saying  something in whispers to master. And soon, master's eyes would turn red and close up.","Ní ipò yẹn, gẹ́gẹ́ bí Sènábù ṣe sọ, màdáámú máa ń sọ nǹkan kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́ sí ọ̀gá.

671,"Then he would stagger and fall on the bed, feeling dizzy no doubt.","Lẹ́yìn náà, ọ̀gá á ta gbọ̀n-ọ́n gbọ̀n-ọ́n, á sì ṣubú sórí ibùsùn pẹ̀lú òyì láìṣiyèméjì."
672,"And for a long time, master would lic down unconscious - like an epileptic victim.","Fún ìgbà pípẹ́, ọ̀gá á dùbúlẹ̀ láìlérò bí oníwárápá."
673,Zenabu gave the account to Mama innocently and with tears welling up in her eyes.,Sènábù ṣàlàyé fún màmá pẹ̀lú ọkàn mímó àìlẹ́bí àti omijé lójú rẹ̀.
674,"Labake.... Labake.... What a terrible name for anybody to called by! It tasted sour in the mouth, like bitter leaf, twisting the tongue, soiling the mouth like the stickly mess of saltless okro soup.","Làbákẹ́…… Làbákẹ́……orúkọ tí a fi ń ṣé pè orúkọ!

675,Alamu`s mother mused in disgust and spat out the bitter-leaf name of her son`s wife.,"Ìyá Àlàmú dá sọ̀ pẹ̀lú ìrira, ó sì tutọ́ orúkọ ìyàwó ọmọ rẹ̀ kíkorò jáde."

677,Mama and Labake were clearly not the best of friend.,Óhàn gbangba pé màmá àti Làbákẹ́ kì í ṣe ọ̀rẹ́ gidi rárá.
678,"The two, all along had merely been tolerating and enduring each other.",Àwọn méjèèjì kàn ṣáà ń níì gbàmọ́ra àti ìfaradà fún ara wọn ni.
679,What else could they have done in the circumstance? Nothing.,Kíni wọ nìbá tí ṣe? Kòsí.
680,Labaake was the only wife of Mama`s only son...,Làbákẹ́ ni ìyàwó kan ṣoṣo fún ọmọ kan ṣoṣo tí màmá ni….
681,And Mama was the mother of Labake`s loving husband... so it had been difficult for anyone of them to launch a direct attack.,"Màmá sì ni ìyáfún ọkọ Làbákẹ́ àtàtà... nítorí náà, ó le fún ìkankan nínú wọn láti dojú ìjà kọ ẹnìkejì."
682,If they did not like each other surely they must be at each other`s throat!,"Bí wọn kò bá fẹ́ràn ara wọn, dájú dájú wọ́n gbọ́dọ̀ máa dẹ ara wọn!"
683,"But, all along, Alamu had been living up to expectation in his role as an umpire.",Ṣùgbọ́n gbogbo ìgbà ni Àlàmú ń ṣe ojúṣe rẹ̀ gẹ́gẹ́ bí onídàájọ́.
684,He very well knew how to satisfy Mama. He knew the way to please his darling.,Ó mọ bí ó ṣe máa tẹ́ màmá lọ́rùn dáadáa. Ó sì mọ bí ó ṣe máa tẹ́ olólùfẹ́ rẹ̀ lọ́rùn.
685,"That was not to say, however, that he had succeeded in striking a perfect balance.",Èyí kò túmò sí pé ó ti ṣa ṣeyọrí nínú títẹ́ àwọn méjèèjì lọ́rụ̀n ní pípé.
686,"For instance, there had been times when his mother would ask him to stop saying. `my wife and I... my wife and I`, all of the time in her presence.","Fún àpẹẹrẹ, àwọn àsìkò kán wà tíì yá rẹ̀ ní kí ó yéé máa sọ“èmi àti ìyàwó mi….èmi àti ìyàwó mi” ní gbogbo ìgbà ní ìṣojú wọn."
687,It was getting on her nerves.,Ó ń bí wọn nínú.
688,And there were times when Labake would warn Alamu about tying himself too much to his mother`s apron strings.,Àwọn ìgbàmìíràn sì wà tí Làbákẹ́ á máa kìlọ̀ fún Àlàmú láti já ara rẹ̀ gbà kúrò ní ọmọọmú.

690,"But now, it did not seem there was going to be any way of curtailing Mama`s outburst.","Ṣùgbọ́n nísinsìnyí, kò jọ wí pé yóò ṣeésẹ láti dín asọ̀ màmá kù."
691,She`d started fuming... `,Wọ́n ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í sọ̀rọ̀ pẹ̀lú ìbínú...
692,"Now this follish boy, Alamu, would know what I`d been talking about ever since`s she told herself,","“Nísinsìnyí, Àlàmú ọmọ òpònú yìí, á wá mọ nǹkan ti mo ti ń sọlá tii ye ọjọ́ yìí"", Ó ń so lọ́kàn ara rẹ̀"

696,She`d told him to be very careful.,Ó ti sọfún un pé kí ó ṣọ́ra gidi gidi.
697,She`d told him how dangerous a woman could be,Ó ti sọfún un bí obìnrin ṣe lè léwu sí.
698,she was a woman herself and she knew everything.,"Obìnrin ni òun fúnrarẹ̀, ó sì mọ gbogbo nǹkan."
699,She knew a woman could at the same time be as destructive as a rattlesnake...,Ó mọ̀ pé obìnrin tún lè mú ìparun wábí i paramọ́lẹ̀.
700,"`Keep your secrets to yourself Alamu.

702,Alamu open your ears properly and listen to me...`,"Àlàmú, la etí rẹ dáadáa kí o gbọ́ mi”…"
703,"But, did Alamu listen? Did he ever listen?","Àmọ́, ṣé Àlàmú gbọ́? Ṣé ó gbọ́ rí?"
704,Here was the result of closing ears to the voice of wisdom and experience.,Àbájáde kíkọ etí dídi sí ohùn ọgbọ́n àti ìrírí rè é.
705,Learning this bitter experience might makes the scales fall from his eyes.,Ẹ̀kọ́ láti inú ìrírí kíkorò yìí lè mú kì ìpẹ́ojú rẹ̀ sí.
706,"Ever since Mama arrived, she`d been avoiding talking to Labake directly, even eating her food.","Láti ìgbà tí màmá ti dé, ó ti ń yẹra láti bá Làbákẹ́ sọ̀rọ̀ tààrà, títí mọ́ oúnjẹ rẹ̀ ní jíjẹ."
707,She`d been feeding on the eko and the gari she brought from the district.,Ẹ̀kọ àti gaàrí tí ó gbé wá láti ilé ni ó ń jẹ.
708,With the exception of the period-of-the-day casual greetings and some occasional tip-of-the-tongue  remarks to Mama.,"Yàtọ̀ sí ti ìkíni àsìkò àti ìbániṣọ̀rọ̀ orí ahọ́n, Làbákẹ́ náà kò kọjá ààyè rẹ̀."
709,Umpire' had not been as vigilant as before.,“Onídàájọ́” náà kò ráyè ṣọ́ wọn bí i ti tẹ́lẹ̀.
710,His own present problem was enough for him.,Ìṣòro tó bá a lọ́wọ́lọ́wọ́ tó fún un.
711,"He, therefore, had no time to watch the game anymore.","Fún ìdí èyí, kò ní ààyè láti wo ìran náà mọ́."
712,There were rough kicks and foul play - a lot of blows below the belt!,Ọ̀pọ̀ ìgbákúgbàá àti àṣì gbá ni wọ́n ń gbá pẹ̀lú ìkúùkù abẹ́nú tó rú òfin eré.
713,"As Labake went about the household business, Mama`s menacing gaze chased her all about - into, the toilet, into the bedroom, into the kitchen and finally into her bedroom, where Mama`s gaze seemed to have pinned her down!","Gbogbo bí Làbákẹ́ ṣe ń siṣẹ́ ilé, màmá ń fi ìwò ìyọnu lé e ká, wọ ilé ìgbọ̀nsẹ̀, wọ balùwẹ̀, wọ ilé ìdáná, àti parí parí ẹ̀, lọ sínú yàrá rẹ̀, níbi tí wíwò màmá dè é mọ́!"

716,The time had come to speak up!,Àsìkò ti tó láti lahùn!

718,She would deal with her herself - her own way.,Á dá sẹ̀ríà fún un - lọ́nà tirẹ̀.

721,"`What, Mama?`","“Kíni yẹn, màmá?”"
722,"`Yes. Yes, Labake. It has been let out of the bag - the cat.","“Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni. Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni,  Làbákẹ́….ó ti tú – àṣírí."
723,"If you don`t know what that means, go back to your father and mother and ask.... Yes:","Bí o kò bá mọ ìtumọ̀ ìyẹn, padà lọ bá ìyá àti bàbá rẹ kí o bèèrè… Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni."
724,The wind has blown and it has exposed the anus of the hen!`,"Afẹ́fẹ́ ti fẹ́, a ti rí fùrọ̀ adìyẹ!"
725,`Mama what are you talking about?`,"“Kíni nǹkan tí ẹ̀ ń sọ̀rọ̀ nípa ẹ̀, màmá?”"
726,`You have become powerless from this moment onward`!,“Ipárẹ ti pin láti àkókò yìí lọ”!

730,"Mama had become transformed, she was no longer an ordinary human being.","Màmá ti wá paradà, kì í ṣe ènìyàn lásán mọ́."
731,Great tissue - thorns crawled out of the face of a ghost of vengeance suddenly let loose.,"Iṣan ńlá ńlá farahàn lójú rẹ̀, ó sì jẹ́ kí ó jọ ẹlẹ́mìí èṣù, bí i ti òkú tó fẹ́ gbẹ̀san lójijì."
732,"Labake looked at her mother-in-law, covered her face up with her palms and screamed.","Làbákẹ́ wojú ìyá ọkọ rẹ̀, ó fi àtẹ́lẹwọ́ rẹ̀ bojú ó sì hàn."
733,But Mama continued.,Ṣùgbọ́n màmá tẹ̀síwájú.
734,`Labake.... Labake.... Look at me I say now!,Làbákẹ́…… Làbákẹ́…..wojú mi mo wí báyìí!

739,"I thank my fore-fathers, they are wide awake.","Mo dúpẹ́ lọ́wọ́ àwọn bàbá-ńlá mi, wọ́n lajú sílẹ̀."
740,And now they have intervened. So my son will be saved.`,"Ní báyìí, wọ́n sì ti gbèjà mi. Fún  ìdí èyí, ọmọ mi á rí ìgbàlà."
741,`But.... But...  But Mama. What is it Mama? Are you angry with me?,“Ṣùgbọ́n… ṣùgbọ́n… ṣùgbọ́n màmá. Kílódé? Màmá ṣe ẹ̀ ń bínú sí mi ni?”

746,`But you can maim my joy - not so?,“Ṣùgbọ́n o lè pa álára – àbí bẹ́ẹ̀ kọ́?
747,I`ll strip myself naked before you now and tear you to pieces with my teeth!,"Màá já ara mi sí hòòhò níwájú ẹ báyìí, màá sì fi eyín mi ya ẹ́ sí wẹ́wẹ́!"
748,"Wait, let me strip myself naked!","Dúró, jẹ́ n já ara mi sí hòòhò!"
749,"Mama removed her head tie, removed her buba, took off her slippers, and threw down her wrapper! She held on for a while - breathing heavily....","“Màmá tú gèlè rẹ̀, ó bọ́ bùbá rẹ̀, ó bọ́ bàtà, ó sì ju ìró rẹ̀ sílẹ̀! Ó dúró díẹ̀ –ó ń mí lókè lókè...'"

751,"It was a taboo for young person to gaze at the naked body of an old woman of Mama`s age, whoever dared it was, in fact doomed. Doomed for ever.","Èèwọ sì ni fún ọ̀dọ́ láti wo ara àgbàlàgbà irú ọjọ́ orí màmá yìí, ẹni tí ó bá dán an wò, ìparun á dé bá a. Áparun títí láé."
752,"A dreadful curse on such a fellow, the fellow will never live to old age and would die in unusual and mysterious circumstances.","Ègún burúkú lórí irú ẹni bẹ́ẹ̀. Irú ẹni bẹ́ẹ̀ kò ní tágbà, á sì kú ikú àrà ọ̀tọ̀."

768,There is an answer to that. His head will be put right again.,Ìdáhùn wá sí ìyẹn. Orí rẹ̀ á tún padà bọ̀ sípò.
769,His mind will be restored. And all of you would be put to shame’.,Ọ̀kan rẹ̀ á padà bọ́ sípò. Ojú á sì ti gbogbo yín.
770,‘All of us? Who? Me? Shame? Do I deserve shame in Alamu’s house?’,“Gbogbo wá? Tani? Èmi? Ìtìjú? Ṣé ó yẹ kí ojú ti mí nínú ilé Àlàmú?”.

775,‘Heavens”! Labake jumped up in agony. So high her head almost touched the bedroom ceiling. She flopped to the ground and started rolling in tears.,“Ọ̀run ò!” Làbákẹ́ fò sókè nínú ìrora.

781,An eccentric husband plus a wicked accusation.,Ọkọ aláágànnáayírí aparọ́mọ́ni takoni.

784,Another fellow once said that marriage was a besieged castle - with some people struggling to get inside and others struggling to get out. That fellow was correct. Hundred per cent. ,"Ẹlòmíràn tilẹ̀ tí sọ ọ́ rí pé ìgbeyàwó jẹ́ ilé ogun pẹ̀lú àwọn ènìyàn tí wọn gbìyànjú láti wọlé tí àwọn mìíràn sì ń jìjàkadì láti jáde.

786,"Mama was happy at the effect her accusation had created on Labake. That's how it is meant to be, she deserved it - even more.","Inú Màmá dún sí iṣẹ́ tí ìfẹ̀sùnkàn rẹ̀ ti ṣe lára Làbákẹ́. Bí ó ṣe yẹ kí ó ri nìyẹn, ohun ó tọ́ sí Làbáḱe nìyẹn, jù bẹ́ẹ̀ lọ pàápàá."

790,And there should be no further delay.,"Ìdúró ò sí, ìbẹ̀rẹ̀ ò sí mọ́."

793,"The herbalist’s asylum, was situated some five kilometres off Age village in an isolated clearing inside the deep forest. The yard was open and it stretched over some four acres of land, barricaded by high cemented walls topped with broken bottles and wire gauze.","Ọgbà oníṣègùn náà wà níbí i máìĺì márùn-ún sí Abúlé Àgé, tí a dátẹ̀ sínú igbó kìjikìji.

796,"In a quick flash, the picture of Esuniyi, came in hand, and a ferocious look on his face, came to Mama.","Ní kíákíá, àwòrán Èṣùníyì pẹ̀lú ẹgba lọ́wọ́ àti ìwò ìrorò lójú rẹ̀ wá sórí Màmá."
797,"She saw Esuniyi sweating, his eyes bulging and his whip mercilessly circling round the bodies of those stubborn ones who would not obey his instructions.","Ó rí i tí Èṣùníyì ń làágùn, tí ojú rẹ̀ràn tí àtòrì rẹ̀ sì ń dá sẹ̀ríà sí ara àwọn aláìgbọràn tí kò tẹ̀lé àṣẹ rẹ̀."
798,‘Stop! Stop that noise!’ Mama imagined Esuniyi shouting.,“Dákẹ́! Dákẹ́ ariwo yẹn!” Màmá ń rò ó bí Èṣùníyì tí ṣe ń pariwo.
799,"‘Remain standing where you are!’ ‘Alright, it is time for food.","“Dúró sibí tí o wà! Ó dáa, àsìkò oúnjẹ rè é."
800,And you are all going to take the food sitting down on that wooden bench in the open yard.,Gbogbo yín sì máa gba oúnjẹ  náà lórí ìjokòó lórí àga onígi tó wà nínú àgbàlá.
801,Not standing up like that... You hear me! You! Why are you still standing to eat your food?,Kì í ṣe lórí ìdúró bá yẹn…. O gbọ́ mi! Ìwọ! Kílódé tí ó ṣì ń dúró jẹun?”
802,Didn’t you hear my instruction?’,“Ṣé o ò gbọ́ àṣẹ mi ni?”
803,Wham! Wham! Wham! Mama imagined Esuniyi’s whip circling round the body of two of his patients.,“Wàmù!Wàmù!Wàmù!” Màmá ń rò ó bí pàṣán Èṣùníyì ṣe ń dún lára àwọn aláìsàn rẹ̀ méjì.
804,"They quickly sat down on the wooden bench along with the others and continued eating their food, eyeing their master in fear.","Kíá ni wọ́n jókòó lórí àga onígi náà pẹ̀lú àwọn yóòkú wọ́n tí wọ́n sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ sí jẹ oúnjẹ wọn, tí wọn ń wojú onítọ́ọ̀jú wọn tìbẹ̀rù-tìbẹ̀rù."
805,Mama opened her eyes briefly and heaved a sigh. In another minute she closed them again - and other images came crowding into her memory....,"Láìfa ọ̀rọ̀ gùn, Màmá lajú, ó sì mí àmíkàn. Ní ìṣẹ́jú mìíràn, ó tún pa ojú dé àwọn àwòrán mìíràn tún wá sí orí rẹ̀……."
806,"Evening time in the asylum.... Mama saw, in her mind’s eye, Esuniyi shaving the bushy hair of some of his patients.",Ní ọwọ́ ìrọ̀lẹ́ nínú ọgbà ìtọ́jú….. màmá tún fi ojú inú ọkàn rẹ̀ rí Èṣùníyì níbi tí ó ti ń fá irun tó kún bí igbó tó wà lórí aláìsàn rẹ̀.
807,"Mama imagined herself holding Alamu by the handd, leading him to Esuniyi’s asylum with tears in her eyes. And Esuniyi rushing out of his house with a whip to meet them.","Màmá rò ó bí òun ṣe fa Àlàmú lọ́wọ́, tí ó sì ń mú u lọ sí ọgbà ìtọ́jú Èṣùníyì pẹ̀lú omijé lójú. Àti bí Èṣúńiyì ṣe ń sáré bọ̀ níta láti pàdé e wọn pẹ̀lú pàsán lọ́wọ́."
808,"In a minute, he was lashing out at Alamu with the long whip, beating him to submission, beating sense into his head to let him know he was in a house, a special house, where he had to conform...","Láàárín ìṣẹ́jú kan, ó ti ń kó o bo Àlàmú, tí ó ń nàá kí ara rẹ̀ lè balẹ̀, tí ó ń na ọgbọ́n sínú orí rẹ̀ kí ó lè mọ̀ pé inú ilé, ilé ọ̀tọ̀ tí ara rẹ̀ ti níláti balẹ̀ ní ó wà…."
809,Next she saw Esuniyi shaving Alamu’s own head and then chaining his hands and feet.,"Lẹ́yìn èyí, ó tún rí i tí Èṣùníyì fá irun orí Àlàmú tí ó sì fi sẹkẹ́sẹkẹ̀ dè é tọwọ́ tẹsẹ̀."
810,"That was where she would take her son, to get his present problem solved.","Ibẹ̀ ni á mú ọmọ rẹ̀ lọ, láti rí i pé ìṣòro rẹ̀ lọ́wọ́ lọ́wọ́ yìí yanjú."
811,And she knew too well that the problem would be solved there in a matter of weeks.,Ó sì mọ̀ dáadáa pé ìṣòro náà áníyanjú lááàrín ọ̀sẹ̀ mélòó kan.
812,Esuniyi was a master of his art. Mama had witnessed how he had solved three of such problems for the villagers....,Èṣúńiyì mọ̀ iṣẹ́ rẹ̀ dunjú. Màmá tirí bí ó ṣe yanjú irú ìṣòro bẹ́ẹ̀ mẹ́ta ní abúlé .…
813,"And how his name was, consequently, on the lips of all the inhabitants of the one hundred and fifty villages of the district...",Àti bí wọ́n ṣe bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í jẹ orúkọ rẹ̀ lẹ́nu láàrin àwọn olùgbé abúlé bí i àádọ̀jọ tí ó wà ní agbègbè náà…..
814,"Yes, Esuniyi cured the man from Kange... The young woman from Akokura, whom he later married...","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, Èṣùníyì wo ọkùnrin ará Kange sàn, àti ọmọbìnrin tí ó wá láti Akókurà tí ó padà fẹ́……."
815,He restored the violent body from Jooda to normalcy. There were other cases Mama could not immediately remember.,Ó mú ara Jooda tí kò balẹ̀ padà bọ̀ sípò. Àwọn ìwòsàn mìíràn tí Màmá kò lè rántí ní kíákíá.
816,Esuniyi’s aslylum was surrounded by a strange aura.,Àwọn ẹ̀mí àìrí kan ni ó yí ọgbà ìtọ́jú Èṣùníyì ká.
817,"You would see him pounding something inside the morter, grinding something on the stone, chewing, boiling and burning one thing or the other.","Wà á rí i níbi tí ó ti ń gún nǹkankan lódó, à lọ nǹkankan lórí ọlọ, á jẹ́ nǹkan lẹ́nu, á bọ nǹkankan tàbí kí ó jó nǹkan mìíràn."
818,He would preserve the hair of his patients for medicinal purposes.,Á tọ́jú irun orí àwọn aláìsán rẹ̀ tí ó fáfún ìṣègùn.
819,"Burn part of the hair, mix it with some herb and an oily substance, pour it back on the shaved heads and his patients and start reciting incantation for each one of them...","Á jó lára rẹ̀, á pò ó pọ̀ mọ́ àwọn ewé àti nǹkan ọlọ́ràá kan, á wá dà á padà sí orí àwọn aláìsàn rẹ̀ tí ó ti fá yìí, á wá bẹ̀rẹ̀ sí pọfọ̀ fún wọn lọ́kọ́ọ̀kan…."
820,"That was calling on the invisible power to enter the patients’ heads,  cool down their brain and restore normalcy to them.","Èyí tí ó túmọ̀ sí pípe agbára àìrí kan láti wọ orí àwọn aláìsàn náà, kí ó mú ọpọlọ wọn wálẹ̀, kí ó sì mú wọn bọ̀ sípò padà."
821,In the dead of the night he would chant special incantations against the enemies of his patients. The effect was usually dramatic.,"Ní òru ọ̀gànjọ́, á pe àwọn ọfọ̀ ọ̀tọ̀ kan láti tako àwọn ọ̀tá àwọn aláìsàn rẹ̀. Isẹ́ òog̀un yìí sì máa ń dàbí i eré."
822,One by one the enemies were usually made to suffer for their atrocities. You would see them committing suicide by hanging on the tall araba or the iroko; you would see them plunging head-long into river or crawling on their knees to Esuniyi to beg for forgiveness.,Lọ́kọ̀ọ̀kan ni àwọn ọ̀tá náà máa jìyà ẹ̀sẹ̀ wọn.

823,"Mama now looked at Labake, the way one looks at the stinking rubbish inside the rubbish pit and silently cursed her.","Màmá tún wo Làbákẹ́, tìkà-tẹ̀gbin ……."
824,She raised up her head and saw Labake holding her son’s hand inside the picture hanging on the wall of the sitting room and smiling. A treacherous smile on the face of a devil!,"Ó gbójú sókè, ó sì rí fọ́tò Làbákẹ́ tí ó di ọwọ́ ọmọ rẹ̀ mú tí ó sì rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́ lára ògiri yàrá ìgbàlejò wọn. Ẹ̀rín ìyàngì lójú èṣù."
825,"All through the previous day when Mama confronted Labake, Alamu was not in. He went out to town and did not come back until late in the night when everybody had gone to sleep.","Ní gbogbo ìgbà tí Màmá dojúkọ Làbákẹ́ lánàá, Àlàmú  kò sí nílé.

826,"Quietly, he had sneaked inside, locked the door on himself and soon was snoring.","Ó yọ́ kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́ wolé, ó sì ti ìlẹ̀kùn mọ́ ara rẹ̀, tí ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í hanrun láìpẹ́."
827,He woke up late in the morning to discover that Mama had thing inside her basket in preparation for the return journey to the district.,"Ó pẹ́ láàárọ̀ kí ó tó jí, kí ó sì tó rí i wí pé Màmá ti múra, ó sì ti ń di apẹ̀rẹ̀ rẹ̀ ní ìmúra sílẹ̀ láti padà lọ sí abúlé."
828,Then he saw also that his breakfast was ready on the table.,Ó sì tún rí i  wí pé oúnjẹ òwúrọ̀ rẹ̀ ti wà lórí tábílì.
829,"He looked at his mother for a moment and turned his eyes to the food on the table the next minute. He seemed to be undecided... Well, there was no need for any hurry on the part of Mama.","Ó wo ìyá rẹ̀ díẹ̀, ó sì tún yíjú sí tábìlì ibi tí oúnjẹ wà ó jọ wí pé kò ì tí ì pinnu èyí tó fẹ́ ṣe…. Kò sí ìdí fún un láti kánjú ní ti Màmá."
830,"He could talk to her after food. So, Alamu took his seat at table.","Ó lè bá wọn sọ̀rọ̀ lẹ́yìn oúnjẹ. Fún ìdí èyí, Àlàmú jókòó sídìí tábìlì."
831,"Before Mama ever had the time to raise up her head, the first two spoonfuls of rice had disappeared inside Alamu’s tummy!","Kí Màmá tó ráyè gbórí sókè, ṣíbí ìrẹsì méjì ti wọ ikùn rẹ̀."
832,"And when Mama suddenly jumped up from her seat and said,","Nígbà náà ni màmá déédé fò sókè lórí ìjókòó rẹ̀ tí ó ní,"
833,‘Alamu! Alamu! I want to talk to you.... before your meal!... before your meal’ - it was too late!The third spoon of rice was well ion its way down Alamu’s throat.,"“Àlàmú! Àlàmú! Mo fẹ́ báọ sọ̀rọ̀…..kí ó tó jẹun!.....kí o tó jẹun!” - Óti pẹ́ jù, ṣíbí ìrẹsì kẹ́ta ti wà lọ́nà ọ̀fun Àlàmú."
834,What was left for Mama to do was to move to the table and examine the soup in front of her son.,Nǹkan tí ó kù fún Màmá láti ṣe ni kí ó lọ sídìí tábìlì kí ó sì ṣe àgbéyẹ̀wò ọbẹ̀ tí ó wà níwájú rẹ̀.
835,Egusi soup... Yes... But with some blackish substance inside it.,Ọbẹ̀ Ẹ̀gúsí…. Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni….. pẹ̀lú àwọn nǹkan dúdúdúdú nínú rẹ̀.
836,Her keen eyes saw it.,"Ojú rẹ̀ mu, ó sì rí i."
837,The type Zenabu talked about.,Irú àwọn èyí ti Sènábù ń sọ.
838,Alamu glanced back strangely at his mother.,Àlàmú padà wo ìyá rẹ̀ ní ìwò tó ṣàjèjì.
839,Why all these fuss over egusi soup?,"Kí ni gbogbo ìrọ̀kẹ̀kẹ̀ yìí, lórí ọbẹ̀ ẹ̀gúsí lásán?"
840,‘What is this you are eating Alamu?’,“Kí ni èyí tí ò ń jẹ́ yìí Àlàmú?”
841,"The old woman asked - rather unnecessarily, but nonetheless meaningfully.","Ìyá àgbà náà bèèrè - ìbéèrè tí kò nílò, ṣúgbọ̀n tí ó nítumọ̀ sí i."
842,‘Rice.’,“Ìrẹsì”
843,‘I mean this?’,“Èyí ni mò ń sọ?”
844,"‘Soup Mama’. Alamu laughed - the usual prolonged, full-throated laugh which two days ago left tears trickling down Mama’s cheeks. Mama moaned.","“ Ọbẹ̀ ni Màmá ”, Àlàmú  rẹ́rìn-ín bí ó ti máa ń rín-in, irú èyí tí ó rín níjẹta tí ó fa kí Màmá bú sẹ́kún. Màmá gbin."
845,‘Alamu... Alamu... Are you sure this is ordinary soup?’,“Àlàmú… Àlàmú… ṣé ó dá ọ lójú pé ọbẹ̀ lásán ni èyí?
846,‘Yes. Just soup Mama... Good soup. What else?’,"“Bẹ́ẹ̀ni. Ọbẹ̀ ni Màmá… Ọbẹ̀ tó dára. Kí ló kù?”,"
847,"Mama gave the plate of soup a hard, suspicious stare and shook her head.","Màmá wo abọ́ ọbẹ̀  náà ní ìwò tó le, tí ó sì mú ìfura dání."
848,Yes... That black substance again. She saw it clearly - sprinkled all over the egusi soup...,Bẹ́ẹ̀ni……kiní dúdú yẹn tún ní. Ó rí i dáadáa - tí wọ́n wọ́nọn sórí ọbẹ̀ ègúsí náà...
849,Was Alamu blind? Surely he has been charmed... Was Alamu’s nostrils blocked?,Ṣe ojú Àlàmú fọ́ ni? Dájúdájú wọ́n ti sàsí i…… ṣé ihò imú Àlàmú dí ni?
850,Mama cast a strange look at her son... Alamu continued to eat the rice and his mouth worked greedily.,"Màmá tún wo ọmọ rẹ̀ kòòró... Àlàmú ń bá oúnjẹ rẹ̀ lọ ní jíjẹ, ẹnu rẹ̀ sì ń ṣe wọ̀mùwọ̀mù."
851,Mama heard the sound of his mouth and felt some pain - some sharp pain - inside her throat.,"Màmá ń gbọ́ ohùn ẹnu Àlàmú bí ó ṣe ń dún, ọ̀nà ọ̀fun rẹ̀ sì dùn ún púpọ̀."
852,"Alamu washed his rice down with water and noisily, continued munching on and on....","Àlàmú fi omi ti ìrẹsì rẹ̀ lọ sínú, ó sì tẹ̀síwájú pẹ̀lú oúnjẹ rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú dídún ẹnu rẹ̀..."
853,What would he not eat? There was nothing Labake gave him that he would not eat!,Kí ni kò lè jẹ́? Kò sí nǹkan kí nǹkan tí Làbákẹ́ fún un tí kò lè jẹ!
854,"If she prepared a bowl of excreta for him as food, Alamu would take it with relish and satisfaction.","Bí ó bá se abọ́ ìgbọ̀nṣẹ̀ kan fún un bi oúnjẹ, Àlàmú  á jẹ ẹ́ pẹ̀lú ìgbádùn àti ìtẹ̀lọ́rùn."
855,"If she gave him animal urine for water, Alamu would accept it and gulp it down his throat thirstily - and even thank her for it!","Bí ó bá gbé ìtọ̀ ẹranko fún  un gẹ́gẹ́ bí omi Àlàmú  á gbàá, á sì gbé e mì tòùngbẹ tòùngbẹ - á sì tún dúpẹ́ lọ́wọ́ rẹ̀ fún un."
856,Who would save him now? None but Esuniyi...,Ta ni yóò wá gbàálà báyìí? Kò sẹ́lòmíràn àfi Èṣúńiyì…
857,Esuniyi to the rescue! Delay could be dangerous.,Èṣùníyì ló lè gbà á! Ìjáfara léwu.
858,Alamu might soon take to the streets!,Àlàmú mà lè já sí títì láìpẹ́!
859,Mama grabbed her basket and stumbled out of the house.,Màmá ki apẹ̀rẹ̀ rẹ̀ mọ́lẹ̀ ó sì sá kúrò nínú ílé.
860,She knew that in a matter of days she would have to be back in town again to fetch Alamu.,"Ó mọ̀ pé láàrin ọjọ́ mélòó kan, òun á ní láti padà wá sí ìgboro láti mú Àlàmú."
861,There should be no delay at all.,Kò gbọdọ̀ jáfara rárá.
862,The task before her was a task that must be accomplished - with dispatch.,Iṣẹ́ kíákíá ló wà níwáju rẹ̀.
863,"As the days rolled by, Alamu sank deeper and deeper into own private world. So much so that Labake feared that her husband was soon going to go completely deaf and dumb - these in addition to the already heavy load of problems he was carrying on his shoulder. Some time ago, he had time to say one or two words in response to questions or requests from people, but not any longer.","Bí ọjọ́ ṣe ń gorí ọjọ́, Àlàmú túbọ̀ ń rì sínú ayé àdáwà rẹ̀.

864,"If anybody hissed now, Alamu no longer took notice; if anybody grumbled Alamu no more listened; if Labake shouted protests over cigarette he was smoking or the beer he was drinking, more frequently now than ever before, Alamu no longer cared.","Bí ẹnìkan bá pòṣé nísìnyí, Àlàmú ò ṣàkíyèsí mọ́; bí ẹnikẹ́ni bá kùn, Àlàmú kò tẹ́tí mọ́; bí Làbákẹ́ bá ń tẹnumọ́ ìkìlọ̀ rẹ̀ lórí sìgá tí ó ń fà  tàbí  ọtí tí ó ń mu léraléra ju ti tẹ́lẹ̀ lọ, kò kan Àlàmú mọ́."
865,"Wading through the pyramid of files which he kept on top of an old cupboard in his room seemed now to be his main pre-occupation. He would bury his head inside the files for hours and leaf through their pages hastily ans anxiously. Then, pile the files up on the table by his side. Look away and heave a sigh. A few minutes later, he would go back, all over again, to the business of checking and rechecking the files, packing and re-packing them, arranging and re-arranging them. There was no end to it! At times, he would tear off a sheet or two from a particular file, read through it pointing to some sections of it with his forefinger and shaking his head, apparently as he stumbled on something that caught his interest.","Wíwo òkìtì àwọn fáìlì tí ó tọ́jú sókè kọ́bọ́ọ̀dù àtijọ́ kan nínú yàrá rẹ̀ wá di iṣẹ́fún  un.

866,"He suddenly had converted his own room into the big office of a self-styled Business Executive. Except that here he was his own Managing Director, his own Accountant, Auditor, Executive Officer, Typist and Messenger! It was another strange turn of events!","Ó ti déédé sọ yárà rẹ̀ di ọ́fíìsí ńlá tí a dáfún ìlò ara rẹ̀.

867,"Whenever Alamu was not wading through the files, he would be busy sipping his beer, puffing at his cigarette. Now, he no longer vomited, and the cigarette smoke no longer entered into his eyes or made him cough.","Bí Àlàmú kò bá sí nídì́í kí ó máa ṣíwèé lọ ṣíwèé bọ̀, á máa yọ́ ọtí rẹ̀ mu, yóò sì máa fín eruku sìgá rẹ̀.

868,"But he retained his strange laughter, and the effect of the alcohol was still very much with him. Which was one reason why he used to boast to himself that he could drive his car all through the streets of Ibadan with his eyes closed and following the left-hand lane! He could drink six bottles of acid, all at once to quench his thirst! He could, with only two quick steps, descend the stair cases of a two-storey building and get down to its ground floor without any scratch!","Sùgbọ́n ẹ̀rín àbàmì àláriwo rẹ̀ ṣì wà, isẹ́ ọtí kò sì kúrò lára rẹ̀.

869,How was one going to talk to the deaf? Somebody who was stone deaf? Labake tried it several times and failed.,Báwo ni ènìyàn ṣe fẹ́ bá adití sọ̀rọ̀? Ènìyàn tí etí rẹ̀ ti dí pa? Làbákẹ́ ti gbìyànjú láìmọye ìgbà ó sì ti kùnà.

876,"Tears gathered inside Labake’s eyes, tears for Alamu, tears for what she suffered at the hands of Alamu’s mother. How was Alamu going to know her ordeal? How was he going to know about the way his mother raved and raged? And then, those vicious accusations! Who was now going to vindicate her? She bottled all these up inside her mind. There was nobody to tell it to. Tears for this too ... And they came down in a flood ...","Omijé ṣarajọ sójú Làbákẹ́, omijé fún Àlàmú, omijé fún nǹkan tí ó jẹ́ níyà lọ́wọ́ ìyá Àlàmú.

879,"Tinu crawled to him and stood in front of him with her shaky, delicate soft tiny legs. The little girl smiled, showing her newly-formed front teeth, like she did to her mother, now instinctely asking her father to see and admire them.","Tinú rá lọ bá a, ó sì dúró síwájú rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú ẹsẹ̀ ẹlẹgẹ́ kékeré rẹ̀ tí ó máa ń gbọ̀n.

880,"Pa pa pa... Papa... Papapa...' Tinu babbled, She could now stand up straight on her two tiny legs without support. She was probably expecting daddy to congratulate her, before she would proceed to delivering a message - that message!","Bà bà bà ...bàbá...bababa...', Tinú ń sọ̀rọ̀ wẹ́wẹ́, Ó ti wá lè dá dúró lórí ẹsẹ̀ rẹ̀ tín-ín-rín-tín méjì yẹn láìsí ìrànwọ́.

881,"Alamu took a look at his daughter, and then took a look at the bottle of beer in front of him. He seemed to be holding a silent debate within himself over which one to choose... Alamu took another swig from the bottle. He seemed to prefer the bottle!","Àlàmú wo ọmọ rẹ̀, ó sì tún wo ìgò ọtí iwájú rẹ̀.

882,"Then he recoiled and took a hateful look at the intruding little rat in front of him. It was a rather sullen, distant look, as if he was seeing his own child for the first time. He laughed a vociferous laughter. Little Tinu screamed. And crying, she scrambled away on all fours, not waiting to deliver any message.","Lẹ́yìn náà ó fa sẹ́yìn, ó sì wo eku kékeré iwájú rẹ̀ ní ìwò ìrira.

883,"Inside the matrimonial home, Labake literally saw a lurid cloud of smoke, Alamu had set his own home on fire, it appeared. And his mother has readily assisted, sprinkling petrol on the burning roof, to make it an inferno! And what would you do when you find yourself deep inside an inferno? When fire appeared on the mountain? Run, not so?","Nínú ilé ìgbéyàwó yìí, Làbákẹ́ rí àgbájọ èéfín tó pòkudu, Àlàmú ti dá iná sí ilé tirẹ̀ ganan, ó farahàn.

884,"Labake knew what to do. And she set about the business of packing cautiously and methodically. On the day she started, she stood on the balcony of the house and listened as Alamu revived the engine of his old Volkswagen in the garage and later backed the car out. She waited patiently until the car disappeared into the corner of the street with its usual trail of smoke and ear-splitting noise. The she ran back into the room.","Làbákẹ́ mọ ohun tí yóò ṣe.

885,"Inside the room, Labake flew at the standing hanger and started removing her clothes. Hurriedly, she pressed them inside the trunk boxes. Two cupboards inside the room contained trinklets and toiler articles and she started packing the items inside two empty raffia basket containers.","Nínú yàrá, Làbákẹ́ bọ́ ìfasokọ́sí, ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í i yọ àwọn aṣọ rẹ̀.

886,"She stopped briefly and heaved a sigh ... Was she not runnign mad herself? Going crazy? How was she going to pack everything in the room without anybody’s assistance? Her eyes caught the standing fan, the standing mirror and the movable wardrobe. Better to leave those till the last minute. They could be left where they are for the time being.","Ó dáwọ́ dúró díẹ̀, ó sì mí àmíkàn... ṣé òun fúnrarẹ̀ ò máa ya wèrè báyìí? Ṣé kò máa sínwín?

887,"An hour later, the sound of Alamu’s car came to her ears ... Coming back home so soon today?","Lẹ́yìn wákàtí kan, ohun ọkọ̀ Àlàmú tún wá sí etí rẹ̀ ... Ó tún tètè wálé lónìí?"
888,"Hurriedly Labake pushed the trunk boxes to the back of the door, closed the two cupboards, pressed the raffia baskets under the family bed, wiped the perspiration off her brow and came out of the room trying to look cool and collected ... Wasn’t she running mad too? Wasn’t she really going mad? She started breathing heavily.","Kíákíá ni Làbákẹ́ ti àwọn àpótí aṣọ náà sí ẹ̀yìn ilẹ̀kùn, ó pa pẹpẹ méjèèjì dé, ó ti àwọn apẹ̀ẹ̀rẹ̀ náàbọ abẹ́ ìbùsùn ẹbí, ó nu òógùn kúrò ní òkè ojú rẹ̀ ó sì jáde kúrò nínú yàrá, ó ń gbìyànjú láti ṣe dáadáa...

889,"The following morning, she swung into real action, she dressed up, hooked her small handbag under her left armpit, and soon she was on the street hailing a taxi. As she waited for one she silently rehearsed the story she was soon going to relate. It must be neatly related convincingly. Nothing must be left out.","Lówùúrọ́ ọjọ́ kejì, ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ isẹ́ rẹ̀ ní pẹrẹu, ó múra, ó fi báàgì ìfàlọ́wọ́ sí abíyá apá òsì, láìpẹ́ ó ti wà ní òpòpónà tí ó ń pe kabúkabú.

890,"It took Labake more than thirty minutes to get to her destination. Oke-Are was not too direct form Oke-Ado. There was the Beere traffic jam to put up with. The perennial ‘hold-up along Agbeni - Lebanon Street, not to talk of the menace of the danfo and taxi drivers around Ogunpa. The more direct Gege -  Okefofo road had been blocked as a result of a deep trench dug by the Water men. The trench had been there for some two months but noiselessly into an annhs or so, and it appeared the Water men were in no hurry at all to fill it up. So, it was now the longer route which Labake took, but, finally she got to Oke-Ado and entered the lawyers’ chambers. The signboard was imposing.","Ó gba Làbákẹ́ ni bí i ọgbọ̀n ìṣẹ́jú kí ó tó débi tó ń lọ. Òkè-Àrẹ kò lọ tààrà láti Òkè-Àdó.

891,"As she stepped into the receptionist’s office, her heart started beating fast. She filled in the visitor’s slip with trembling fingers, took a seat and looked round strangely, almost timidly. Everything in the lawyers’ chambers followed a definitely rigid pattern; the way she was welcomed; the way answers were given to her requests.","Bí ó ṣe wọ inú ọ́fíìsi olùgbàlejò, ọ̀kan rẹ̀ bẹ̀rẹ̀ sí i ṣe kì-kì-kì.

894,"That’s right, please take your seat, you are welcome.","Ó dáa bẹ́ẹ̀, ẹ jọ̀wọ́, ẹ jókòó, ẹ káàbọ̀."
895,"Could you fill this slip? O.K. I’ll be back right now’. the receptionist walked briskly, but noiselessly into an inner office with the visitors’ slip, and returned exactly two minutes later.","Ṣe ẹ lè ṣe àkọ́sílẹ̀ yìí?

896,"""You will please hold on madam, for about five minutes.""","""Ẹ máa ní láti dúró ìyá, fún bí ìṣẹ́jú márùn-ún""."
897,Labake saw the pictures of the two lawyers running the chambers hanging on the wall. They both wore the typical lawyer’s look - unsmiling; stern-looking; brows knitted; lips tensed; uncompromising features and a penetrating gaze- strong enough to make the beholder blush. One of them wore dark glasses and looked familiar to Labake.,"Làbákẹ́ rí àwòrán agbẹjọ́rò méjì tí ó darí ọ́fíísì náà tí wọn gbé kọ́ ògiri.

898,"After exactly five minutes, Labake was ushered into a room where one of the lawyers, Akanni Mustafa was waiting to receive her.","Lẹ́yìn ìsẹ́jú márùn-ún géérégé, wọn pe Làbákẹ́ wọ yàrá kan, tí ọ̀kan ninú àwọn lọ́yà, ìyẹn Àkànní Mústàfá ti ń dúró láti gbà á lálejò."

901,Barrister Mustafa had obviously noticed the anxiety on the face of Labake.,Amòfin Mústàfá ti ṣàkíyèsí hílà-hílo tí ó hàn lójú Làbákẹ́.
902,He was an experienced lawyer who knew how best to put the clients’ mind at ease.,Ó jẹ́ agbẹjọ́rò tí ó ní ìrírí tí ó sì mọ bí wọ́n ṣe ń fi ọkàn oníbàárà balẹ̀.
903,"Whatever was the magnitude of the problem, he knew that clients would always display fear and anxiety.","Kò síbí ìṣòro náà ṣe lè pọ̀ tó, ó mọ̀ pé àwọn oníbàárà máa ń gbé ìbẹ̀rù àti hílà-hílo wọn sójú."
904,Those who came for criminal cases were usually the most difficult to handle.,Àwọn tí ó bá bá ọ̀rọ̀ ọ̀ràn wá ní wọn máa ń le láti kojú jù.
905,"They would relate their experience sobbing, biting their lips, sucking their fingertips, and pulling at the hair.","Wọn á máa sọ ìrírí wọn tẹkúntẹkún, wọn á má a gé ètè ara wọn jẹ, wọn á má fa orí ìka ọwọ́ wọn mú tàbí kí wọn máa fa irun ara wọn."
906,"And this always made it difficult, if not impossible, to get details immediately.","Àwọn èyí sì má a ń jẹ́ kí ó le tàbí, kí ó má ṣe é ṣe láti rí àlàyé kíkún gbà lẹ́nu wọn."
907,"For them, the fact-finding investigation had to be conducted very tactfully.","Fún irú wọn, ìwádìí òtítọ́ ní láti wáyé pẹ̀lú ọgbọ́n ẹ̀wẹ́."
908,"Otherwise, there would be loop-holes created here and there to the advantage of the opposing camp.",Láìjẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀ àwọn ìhò a pọ̀ fún àǹfààní àwọn ọ̀tá láti rí wọ̀.

910,"With occasional expressions of griefs, clients in this category would shout their innocence and speak a large part of truth - if not the whole truth.","Wọn a máa fi ẹ̀dùn ọkàn wọn hàn lẹ́ẹ̀kọ̀ọ̀kan oníbàárà ní abẹ́ ọ̀wọ́ yìí máa ń fọnrere àìmọ́wọ mẹsẹ̀ wọn, wọ́n sì máa ń sọ púpọ̀ òótọ́ ọ̀rọ̀ wọn ìyẹn tí kì í báá ṣe òótọ́ pọ́nbélé."
911,"And if you cross-examined them twenty times they would repeat the same account with just a little, or no contradiction at all.","Bí ènìyàn bá sì ṣàgbéyẹ̀wò nǹkan tí wọn bá sọ nígbà ogún, nǹkan kan  náà ni ẹni  náà á gbọ́ lẹ́nu wọn pẹ̀lú ìyàtọ̀ bín-ín-tín  tàbí  kí ó má sì ìyàtọ̀ kankan rárá."

913,"Breathlessly, Labake related her experience in her matrimonial home, she traced the story of her happy love affair with Alamu right from the time they were in England through to the time they arrived in Nigeria for the marriage, which was celebrated with pomp and peageantry.","Láísìnmi, Làbákẹ́ ròyìn gbogbo ìrírí rẹ̀ nílé ọkọ rẹ̀, ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ ìtàn ìfẹ́ rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú Àlàmú  láti ìbẹ̀rẹ̀, nígbà tí wọn wà nílùú Englandi títí di ìgbà tí wọ́n fi dé orílẹ̀-èdè Nàìjíríà fún ìgbéyàwó tí wọ́n ṣe táyé gbọ́ tọ́run mọ̀."
914,"Hopes were high for a great future as Alamu secured the lucrative job of an Accountant in the reputable Bajoks Company Limited and their child, Tinu, arrived to add to their joy.","Ìrètí wọn fún  ọjọ́ iwájú wọn ga bí Àlàmú ṣe rísẹ́ asírò-ọ̀rọ̀ sílé iṣẹ́ Bajoks tó gbajúmọ̀, àti ọmọ wọn Tinú tó dé láti wá dákún ayọ̀ wọn."

919,"That was to her, the final straw breaking the camels back.",Sí i ìyẹn ni àjẹǹjẹtán ọ̀rọ̀ náà.
920,Labake did not know how best to knit the events together to make a good case for a divorce suit.,Làbákẹ́ ò mọ ònà tí ó dára jù láti so gbogbo ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ náà pọ̀ láti lè fi ṣe ẹjọ́ ìkọ̀sílẹ̀ gidi.
921,"By the time she’d finished her story, she’d become so completely overcome, she felt so hot all over the body even though the air-conditioner was switched to its maximum  in the lawyer’s office.","Nígbà tí ó máa fi parí ìtàn rẹ̀, ó dàbí i pé wọ́n ti borí, ọ̀rọ̀ náà ti gbọ̀n-ọ́n, ooru mú un ní gbogbo ara, bí ó tilẹ̀ jẹ́ pé ẹ̀rọ amúlétutù wà ní títàn dé góńgó nínú ọ́fíísì agbẹjọ́rò náà."

924,"Lawyer Mustafa pressed a button and it was then that Labake saw, for the first time that all what she said had been tape-recorded.","Agbẹjọ́rò Mústàfá tẹ bọ́tìnì kan, ìgbà  náà ni Làbákẹ́ sẹ̀sẹ̀ rí i pé gbogbo nǹkan tí òun sọ ni wọ́n ti gbà sílẹ̀. "
925,"That, of course, did not matter much to her it was the way of the lawyers.","Gbogbo èyí kò kúkú kàn án, ọ̀nà àwọn agbẹjọ́rò nìyẹn."
926,All she wanted was a quick nullification of the marriage contract. No more no less. And she had every confidence in his lawer whom everybody in town knew for his fearlessness and competence in interpreting the law.,Gbogbo nǹkan tí ó ń fẹ́ ni ìtúká ìgbéyàwó náà ní kíákíá.

929,"We are going to file a divorce suit on five grounds: drunkenness, wickedness, dereliction of duty, neglect of responsibility and total disrespect for thee sacred oath of the Marriage Act on the part of your husband’.","A máa fi ẹ̀sùn yìí kàn lórí ẹ̀sùn márùn-ún yìí; ọtí àmupara, ìwà ìkà, àìka isẹ́-ẹni sí, fífi ojúṣe-ẹni sílẹ̀ àti àìbọ̀wọ̀ fún ìgbéyàwó fún ọkọ yín."

931,"Lawyer Mustafa asked Labake a few other minor questions about the home and requested her to submit to them at the chambers, her marriage certificate and wedding ring for inspection - also their wedding album.","Agbẹjọ́rò Mústàfá bí Làbákẹ́ ní àwọn ìbéèrè kéékèèké mìíràn nípa ilé, ó sì sọ fún  un pé kí ó mú àwọn ìwé-ẹ̀rí àti òrùka ìgbéyàwó wá fún ìtọpinpin àti ìwé àkojọpọ̀àwòrán ìgbéyàwó wọn náà."

937,"We are one and the same, no problem. Labake smiled, the battle was, indeed, half-won. With these two sharp lawyers battling it out on her behalf in court, she had nothing to fear, she was going to defeat Alamu hands down.","Ọ̀kanṣoṣo ni wá, nǹkankan  náà sì ní wá pẹ́lù, kò sí ìṣòro.

938,"When finally Labake rose to go, her countenance had brightened. Her heart had stopped beating that confused rhythm. And what she heard finally from Lawyer Mustafa raised her spirit and cheered her heart. It was like tonic to a troubled heart.","Nígbà tí Làbákẹ́ jàjà dìde láti máa lọ, ojú rẹ̀ ti yàtọ̀.

941,Lawyer Mustafa’s eyes followed his prospective client out.,Ojú Agbẹjọ́rò Mústàfá tẹ̀lé oníbàárà rẹ̀ jáde.
942,What a thoroughly disillusioned that young lady she was.,Irú arábìnrin aláìlẹ́tàn tí ó jẹ́.
943,A lady who had seen the troubles of marraige just once and thinks it would crush her. The problem with her was the problem with thousands of other young housewives in town.,"Obìnrin tí ó ti rí wàhálà ìgbéyàwó ní ẹ̀ẹ̀kan ṣoṣo, ti ó wá ń rò ó pé ọ̀runfúnrarẹ fẹ́ wó pa á.

946,They would swear the end had come.,Wọn á búra pé òpin ti dé. 
947,"They would threaten to take poison, and what they fret so much about, in most cases, are matters that could be amicably settled out of court by their respective parents at home.","Wọn á halẹ̀ láti gbé májèlé jẹ, àwọn nǹkan tí ó ń bí wọn nínú lọ́pọ̀ ìgbà kìí tó nǹkan, irú àwọn ọ̀rọ̀ bẹ́ẹ̀ ṣe é yanjú nílé pẹ̀lú àwọn òbí wọn láìdélé ẹjọ́."
948,"It was either that the husband stayed in the office doing over-time work with the lady secretary for company; that would not eat well at home - indicating that he’d satisfied himself somewhere outside; that he sleeps off immediately after dinner and would not wake up till early the following morning; that he would talk in his sleep about some secret lover or that the husband no longer placed his fat salary at the disposal of members of the household; that he was tied to the apron strings of his parents, neglecting her - the lady of the house and so forth.","Ó lè jẹ́ pé ọkọ pẹ́ níbisẹ́ tí ó ń ṣe àṣekún iṣẹ́ pẹ̀lú akọ̀we rẹ̀ obìnrin; tí ò sì jẹun dáadáa nílé, ìyẹn ń túmọ̀ sí pé ó tí tẹ ara rẹ̀ lọ́rùn níbìkan ni; bí ó bá sùn ní kété tó jẹun alẹ́ tí ò sì jí títí tí ilẹ̀ ọjọ́ kejì fi mọ́; tàbí ó sọ̀rọ̀ olólùfẹ́ ìkọ̀kọ̀ láti ojú oorun tàbí pé ọkọ ò gbé owó oṣù rẹ̀ lé bùkátà àwọn ara ilé mọ̀ tàbí  pé ó sọ ara rẹ̀ mọ́ àwọn òbí rẹ̀ jú, tí ó sì gbójúfò òun dá - ìyẹn ìyàwó ilé àti àwọn ìdí bẹ́è bẹ́ẹ̀ lọ."

950,"If only woman would learn to endure and men would learn to be patient; if only couples would learn to talk over their grievances with mutual love and respect, and laugh over their mistakes and failures, surely, bitterness would find no place in their homes and the question of going to court to settle scores would be entirely out of it. But then, that would put lawyers out of business.","Bí àwọn obìnrin bá lè kọ́ bí a ṣe ń rọ́jú, kí àwọn ọkùnrin náà kọ́ bí a ṣe ń ní sùúrù; bí àwọn tokọtaya bá lè kọ́ bí á ṣe ń sọ̀rọ̀ lórí ìbànújẹ́ wọn pẹ̀lú àjọpín ìfẹ́ àti ìbọ̀wọ̀ kí wọ́n sì rẹ́rìn-ín lórí gbogbo àṣìṣe àti ìkùnà wọn, dájúdájú ìkorò ò ní ráyè nínú ilé wọn, kò sì ní sí ìdí láti gbẹ́jọ́ wọn délé ẹjọ́ kí wọn tó parí ẹ̀.

953,But with one resolution: that she would henceforth meet force with force.,Ṣùgbọ́n pẹ̀lú ìpinnu kan nipé òun a máa gbé ipá wojú ipá ni.
954,"If Alamu was dumb, she too would seal her own lips completely.","Bí Àlàmú bá ya odi, òun náà a se ètè tirẹ̀ pátápátá."
955,"If he shouted at her, she too would yell back at him.","Bí ó bá pariwo mọ́ ọn, òun náà á pariwo padà."
956,"If Alamu laughed out to her, the usual way - like a mad man, she too would open her mouth wide and trumpet her laughter - so loud it would make Alamu himself tremble!","Bí Àlàmú bá rẹ́rìn-ín aláriwo sí i bí ó ṣe máa ń rín in bí i wèrè, òun náà á lánu tirẹ̀ fẹ̀, á sì rín ẹ̀rín aláriwo tirẹ̀ padà, ariwo rẹ̀ á pọ̀ tó bẹ́ẹ̀ tí Àlàmú fúnrarẹ á gbọ̀n rìrì!"

958,Then the inevitable explosion which would for ever separate them.,Lẹ́yìn náà ni ti ariwo tí ò ṣe é sá fún tí yóò tú wọn ká títí láé.
959,The voice of Tinu came to Labake from the  backyard of their flat - mocking her or so it seemed.,Ohùn Tinú wá sí etí Làbákẹ́ láti ẹ̀hìnkùlé ilé wọn – bí ìgbà tí ó bá ń ṣe yẹ̀yẹ́ ní o jọ́.
960,‘Tata - Tatata - Papapa Papa - Papapa’. The little girl staggered towards the sitting room and saw her mother. Then she changed her mind.,"“Tata-tatata – bababa-baba-bababa”, ọmọ náà ta gbọ̀n-ọ́n gbọ̀n-ọ́n lọ́nà yàrá ìgbafẹ́, ó sì rí ìyá rẹ̀. Lẹ́yìn náà ní ó yí ọkàn padà."
961,"""Mama - ma ma ma ma - mama - mamama"".","""Màmá-ma ma ma –màmá-mamama"""
962,"Labake smiled, what a sharp quick-witted child she was.","Làbákẹ́ rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́, irú ọmọ tó gbọ́n wo rè é."
963,"If she had the gift of language, she would have long gone to deliver the message she sent her to her daddy.","Bí ó bá jẹ́ pé ó ni ẹ̀bùn èdè ni, á tí jíṣẹ́ tí ó rán sí bàbá rẹ̀ tipẹ́tipẹ́."
964,"A very sharp, very inquisitive little girl, she would grow up in future with questions on her smart lips.","Ọmọ tí ó dá ṣáṣá , tí ó gbọ́n, bí ó bá dàgbà lọ́jọ́ iwájú ìbéèrè ákún ẹnu rẹ̀."
965,She would want to know why she was the victim of a broken home. Yes... She had  right to know.,Á fẹ́ mọ̀ ìdí tí ó fi jẹ́ pé ilé tí ó túká ni òun ti wá. Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni... ó ní ẹ̀tọ́ láti mọ̀.
966,Labake knew it would be imperative to satisfy Tinu with an explanation.,Làbákẹ́ mọ̀ pé dandan ni kí òun fi àlàyé tẹ́ Tinú lọ́rùn.
967,"There was the need for her, henceforth, to start keeping a diary of the daily events at home.",Ó nílò láti ní ìwé ìjẹ́rìí-ẹni tí yóò máa kọ ìṣẹ̀lẹ̀ ojoojúmọ́ inú ilé náà sí.
968,This diary she would show Tinu in future.,Ìwé yìí ni á fi han Tinú lọ́jọ́ iwájú.
969,"And the poor girl, no doubt, would read it with tears in her eyes.","Ọmọbìnrin aláìsẹ̀, náàá kàá pẹ̀lú omijé lójú láìsí àní-àní."
970,"Her father’s beer and how he vomitted on her, how he pushed her, how he kicked little Tinu herself, the poor girl screaming, tumbling, bruising her lips and the gum of her newly-formed teeth.","Ọtí àmupara bàbá rẹ̀ – bí ó ṣe bì sí i lára tí ó sì tì í, ó ta á nípàá, tí ọmọ náà ń han, tí ó ń yíràá nílẹ̀ tí ó ṣèṣe létè àti èrìgì eyín tuntun rẹ̀ lọ́jọ kan."
971,"Her father’s madness and neglect, shirking all the responsibilities of a father and husband, his uproarious laughter and the detestable habit of keeping late hours outside.","Wèrè àti ìtàdanù bàbá rẹ̀, tí ó ń gbọn ẹ̀tọ́ rẹ̀ gẹ́gẹ́ bí i bàbá àti ọkọ dànù, ẹ̀rín aláriwo rẹ̀, àti wíwọlé lóru rẹ̀ bí ọrọ̀."
972,"All these things combining to push her to seek divorce, not to talk of the constant disgrace and embarrasment from Mama and the neighbours...","Gbogbo èyí ló tì í láti sẹjọ́ ìkọ̀sílẹ̀, kí á tó wá sọ ti àbùkù ti màmá fi ń kàn án àti ìdààmú láti ọwọ́ màmá àti àwọn ará àdúgbò..."
973,Labake was right. The neighbours' attitude had started becoming more and more intolerable. Only last night Labake heard her neighbours talking to her again in the usual way; but this time in a tone that was both sarcastic and contemptuous.,Òtítọ́ ni Làbákẹ́ sọ.

974,"He’s not only mad. She is mad too,","Ọkọ nìkan kọ́ ló ya wèrè, Ìyàwó  náà ya wèrè,"
975,Two mad people. Mad home.,Àwọn wèrè méjì . Ilé wèrè.
976,"She pretends not to hear us, what is she waiting for really? Tell us, mad woman...","Ó ń díbọ́n bí ìgbà tí kò gbọ́ wa, kí ló ń dúró dè, lóòótọ́? Sọ fún  wa, wèrè obìnrin..."
977,They did not face her directly to talk. How then was she going to defend herself?,Wọn kò kọjúsí i tààrà láti sọ̀rọ̀. Báwo ni yóò ṣe wá gbèjà ara rẹ̀?
978,What a tantalising situation! A case of the prosecutor dragging the accused to court to pronounce judgment without a trial.,Irú ipò ìyọnilẹ́nu wò rè é! Ọ̀rọ̀ wá di ti olùpéjọ́ ti ó ń wọ àfẹ̀sùnkàn lọ sí ilé ẹjọ́ láti dájọ́ láìsí ìpèléjọ́.

980,"So, nobody was going to stop her from pursuing the divorce suit to its logical conclusion.","Fún ìdí èyí, kò sí ẹnìkan tí yóò díi lọ́wọ́ láti pe ẹjọ́ ìkọ̀sílẹ̀ náà títí dé òpin."
981,"If in future Tinu asked her questions, she too would have questions to ask Tinu in return, she would ask if Tinu, as a woman could have put up with such a situation and not seek divorce.","Ní ọjọ́ iwájú, bí Tinú bá bi í ní ìbèérè, òun náà á ní ìbèérè láti bi Tinú padà, á bèrè bí Tinú náà bá lè gba irú rẹ̀ gẹ́gẹ́ bí obìnrin, kí ó máa bèèr̀e fún  ìkọ́sílẹ̀."
982,Alamu's head was up in the air.,Orí Àlàmú wà lókè.
983,He kept his eyes on the sitting room ceiling as he hurried out of the house clutching two files.,Ó tẹjúmọ́ òkè àjà yàrá ìgbafẹ́ wọn bí ó ṣe ń kánjú kúrò nínú ilé tí ó sì mú ìwé méjì pọ.

995,"Force with force!  Nothing short of that! In a few days time, Alamu would get the court summons.","Ipá pẹ̀lú ipá ni! Kò sí ohun mìíràn lẹ́yiǹ ìyẹn! Tí a bá máa fì rí ọjọ́ mélòó kan, Àlàmú á gba ìpèlẹ́jọ́ ilé ẹjọ́."
996,His eyes would turn red and his lips would tremble like the leaves on the tree.,"Ojú rẹ̀ á pọ́n, ètè rẹ̀ á sì gbọ̀n bí i ewé orí igi."
997,The summons would wake up all the ghosts inside his crazy head and send him off to the streets  blaring the wild meaningless song of a thoroughly mad man.,"Àwọn ìpèlẹ́jọ́ yẹn á jí gbogbo iwin inú orí ẹ̀ sílẹ̀, á sì rán an sí òpópónà káàkiri, á máa kígbe orin ẹhànnà aláìnítumọ̀ rẹ̀ kíkan kíkan tí ó jọ ti wèrè pọ́ńbélé."
998,"Of course, his mother would be hot on his heels on the streets shouting the eccentric chorus! That was his own palaver... And the palaver of this old witch he called his mother.","Dájúdájú ẹsẹ̀ ìyà rẹ̀ a gbóná lórí òpópónà, tí yóò máa pariwo orin ayírí!

999,"Labake watched, amused, each time Alamu cast his hungry look at the dining room table. He would, for some time gaze intently at the dining table at the usual meal times only to see empty water bottles, cups turned upside down and the unwashed plates piled up with flies at strategic positions, keeping vigilant watch!","Làbákẹ́ ń wò pẹ̀lú ìyanú, nígbàkigbà tí Àlàmú  bá wo tábìlì yàrá ìjẹun tebi-tebi.

1000,Labake had no explanation to give anybody anymore for her action.,Kò sí àlàyé tí Làbákẹ́ fẹ́ ṣe fún ẹnikẹni lórí ìṣe rẹ̀.
1001,She was no longer accountable to anybody.,Kò lè jábọ̀ fún ẹnikẹ́ni mọ́.
1002,She was no longer the lady of the house. She did not see herself as such anymore.,"Òun kọ́ ni ìyá-ilé mọ́, kò sì rí ara rẹ̀ bí i ọ̀kan mọ́."
1003,The lady of the house was the woman in perfect control of the affairs of the home.,Ìyá-ilé ní obìnrin tí gbogbo ìsẹ̀lẹ̀ ilé máa ń wà ní ìkápá rẹ̀.
1004,The woman in love with her husband and the woman whom the husband admired in turn.,"Obìnrin tí ó nífẹ̀ẹ́ ọkọ rẹ̀, tí ọkọ rẹ̀ sì nífẹ̀ẹ́."
1005,The woman in the good books of the relatives of the husband.,Obìnrin tí ó ní àkọ́sílẹ̀ rere lọ́dọ̀ àwọn ẹbí ọkọ rẹ̀ fún.
1006,"So, Labake was not qualified.","Ìdí èyí, Làbákẹ́ kò kún ojú òsùnwọ̀n."
1007,Now she was just a mere tenant in Alamu's house.,Ayálégbé lásán ni nílé Àlàmú báyìí.
1008,"Pending the time she would finally pack and go, everybody should be content with eating just anything.","Títí di ìgbà tí ó máa fi kó ẹrù rẹ̀ lọ pátápátá, kí oníkálùkù ní ìtẹ́lọ̀rùn pẹ̀lú ohunkóhun tó bá rí jẹ."
1009,She knew how best she was going to take care of herself and Tinu.,Ó mọ bí ó ṣe má a tọ́jú ara rẹ̀ àti Tinú.
1010,Alamu Should learn to look after himself.,Kí Àlàmú kọ́ bí ó ṣe máa tọ́jú ara rẹ̀.

1013,"Labake assumed a ""na him sabi"" posture and found herself suddenly in high spirits, she sang in high pitch, her voice rang like a bell.","Làbákẹ́ ń ṣe ìṣe ""òun ló mọ̀"" ọkàn rẹ̀ déédé gbé sókè láti kọ orin rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú ohùn òkè, ohùn rẹ̀ dún bí i agogo."
1014,Her countenance was gay.,Ìrísí rẹ̀ fi inú dídùn rẹ̀ hàn.
1015,She told herself she had no problem.,Ó sọ fún ara rẹ̀ pé òun kò ní ìṣòro kankan.
1016,Nothing to worry about.,Kò ní nǹkankan láti dààmú fún.

1018,Why should she not be happy?,Kí ló ṣe tí inú rẹ̀ kò ní dún?
1019,Her days were numbered in Alamu's house.,Ọjọ́ rẹ̀ ti níye nínú ilé Àlàmú.
1020,The days of sorrow and tribulations were numbered.,Ọjọ́ ìbànújẹ́ àti wàhálà rẹ̀ ti níye.
1021,"The divorce suit was well on the way, she'd almost finished packing her things.","Ẹjọ́ ìkọ̀sílẹ̀ ti wà lọ́nà, òun náà ti fẹ́rẹ̀ ẹ́ palẹ̀mọ́ àwọn nǹkan rẹ̀ tán."

1023,"In spite of the difficult period at home she'd maintained her pretty look, her elegant posture.","Ládúrú ìnira tó wà nílẹ̀ ó sì rẹ̀wà síbẹ̀, ìdúró rẹ̀ dún síbẹ̀."
1024,Nobody seeing her would ever think she was a woman with problems.,Kò sí ẹni tó má ri tá sọ pé obìnrin tó ní ìṣòro ni.
1025,"With her present girlish shape and figure, she could go back to England and re-enter the glamorous world of fashion.","Pẹ̀lú ìrísí omidan tí ó ní lọ́wọ́ lọ́wọ́ yìí, ó lè padà sí England kí ó sì tún padà sí àyè oge síse ẹ̀."
1026,"She would need only three or four months tuning up and reconditioning her body, then catch up finally.","Á kàn nílò láti tún ara rẹ̀ ṣe fún bí oṣù mẹ́ta sí mẹ́rin, á padà sípò."
1027,"So no regrets, she sang hilariously, she clapped her hands, she danced.","Fún ìdí èyí, kò sí àbámọ̀, ó rẹ́rìn-ín tàríyá-tàríyá, ó palẹ̀mọ̀, ó jó."
1028,"Her soprano voice was throated, and trembling, she wiggle her hips the imaginary rhythm of the brass and the wind instruments, she took measured steps forward backward and jumped up excitedly telling herself again and again that she was a happy woman, happy…  h-a-p-p-y! happy... very happy.","Ohùn òkè rẹ̀ tínrín, ó sì ń gbọ̀n rìrì, ó jùdí sí ìlú àti orin inú afẹ́fẹ́ tí ó ń rò lọ́kàn, ó ka ìwọ̀n ẹsẹ̀ díẹ̀ síwájú-sẹ́yìn ó ń fò sókè tìdùnnú-tìdùnnú, ó tún sọ fún ara rẹ̀ léraléra pé obìnrin tí ó láyọ̀ ni òun, ó láyọ̀... l-á-y-ọ̀! láyọ̀... láyọ̀ gidi gan."
1029,"Labake straightened her back and threw out her chest, arms swung freely, her feet marked time left, right, left right, she was sweating!","Làbákẹ́ na ẹ̀yìn, ó sì ti àyà sí wájú, ó jupá láìsídìíwọ́, ó ń gbé ẹsẹ̀ sósì sọ́tùn-ún, sọ́tùn-ún sósì, ó ń làágùn!"
1030,But wait... what really was happening?,Ṣùgbọ́n dúró ná ó ... kí gan-an ló ń sẹlẹ̀?
1031,Labake stopped briefly to ask herself.,Làbákẹ́ dúró díẹ̀ láti bi ara rẹ̀ ní èyí.
1032,"She held her breath minute, pondering.","Ó sé èémí fún ìṣẹ́jú kan, ó ń wòye."
1033,Why all this show of excitement and intoxication?,Kíni ìdí fún gbogbo àfihàn ìdùnnú àti ìyírí yìí?
1034,Was she going mad? Was she going crazy too?,Ṣe òun ti ń ya wèrè? Ṣe òun náà ti ń ya wèrè ni?
1035,"""No, No"", she answered herself... No.","""Rárá, Rárá o"", ó dá ará rẹ̀ lóhùn ... Rárá."
1036,"It was Alamu going mad, it was Alamu who had infact, gone mad.","Àlàmú ló ń sínwín, kódà, Àlàmú ló tí ya wèrè."
1037,Not her ... Not her!,Kìí ṣe òun ...kì í ṣe òun!
1038,Before God and man!,Níwájú Ọlọ́run àti ènìyàn!
1039,"Labake stretched forward her two arms and danced, more enthusiastically, to that imaginary rhythm of music.","Làbákẹ́ ná ọwọ́ rẹ̀ méjéèjì síwájú, ó sì jó pẹ̀lú ìtara sí ìlú àfinúrò orin náà. "
1040,No more problem for her.,Kò sí ìṣòro fún  un mọ́. 
1041,"She was happy, quite happy. She breezed into the sitting room with her clumsy dancing footsteps, her strange, intricate movement of the hips, slowly towards the standing mirror where she became even more excited","Inú rẹ̀ dùn, ó dùn dáadáa.

1042,She threw up her two hands into empty air and twisted her body round and round and round several times - until she became dizzy.,Ó ju ọwọ́ rẹ̀ méjéèjì sínú afẹ́fẹ́ ó sì yípoyípo láìmọye ìgbà títí tí òyì fi kọ́ ọ.

1044,Then the whole building started a momentary journey into space with her as its solitary astronaut...,Lẹ́yìn èyí ni gbogbo ilé bẹ̀rẹ̀ ìrìnàjò àjò pàtàkì sínú òfurufú pẹ̀lú rẹ̀ gẹ́gẹ́ bí adáwakọ̀ òfurufú ...
1045,Why? Why all these? She asked herself again. What's happening? Wasn't she really running out of her mind too?,Kíni ìdí? Kíni ìdífún gbogbo èyí? Ó tún ara rẹ̀ bi. Kí ló ń sẹlẹ̀? Se orí tirẹ̀ náà o ti máa yí báyìí?
1046,Zenabu heaved a heavy sigh from behind the pantry door where she stood watching her madam.,Sènábù mí kanlẹ̀ láti ẹ̀yìn ìlèkùn ilé ìkóunjẹpamọ́ sí níbi tí ó ti ń dúró wòran màdáámù rẹ̀.
1047,"She had heard madam's strange songs and now she's seen her dance a strange, off-beat dance.","Ó ti gbọ́ àwọn orin àjèjì màdáámù, ó sì tún ti rí ijó abàmì rẹ̀ tí ò bálù mu."
1048,"As she tried to get back inside the pantry to avoid her attention, she knocked her head against the wall and tripped over the plates she'd just brought inside the pantry.","Bí ó ṣe wá ń gbìyànjú àti padà sínú ilé oúnjẹ láti má jẹ́ ki wọ́n rí i, ó sẹrí mọ́ ògiri, ó sì ṣísẹ̀ sórí àwọn abọ́ tí ó sẹ̀sẹ̀ kó wọ ilé oúnjẹ náà."
1049,There was something about madam now that was always pushing Zenabu away from her.,Nǹkankan máa ń wà nípa màdáámù báyìí tí ó ń lé Sènábù lára rẹ̀ ni gbogbo ìgbà.
1050,"Each time she saw her something always told her to run away, or hide.","Nígbàkúgbà tí ó ba rí i, nǹkankan máa ń sọ fún un pé kí ó sá lọ, tàbí kí ó sá pamọ́."
1051,Madam had been so aggressive in recent times.,Màdáámù ti ń kanra ganan lẹ́nu ọjọ́ mẹ́ta yìí.
1052,It did not appear that she liked her anymore - the way she now looked and talked to her.,Kò fẹ́ jọ pé ó fẹ́ràn rẹ̀ mọ́ ìsọwọ́ wò ó àti bí ó se ń ba sọ̀rọ̀.
1053,"Each time madam showed up in the sitting room, therefore, Zenabu would find her way into the toilet to answer nature's call!","Nígbàkúgbà tí Màdáámù bá farahàn ní yàrá ìgbafẹ́, kíá ni Sènábù máa ń wábi gbà wọ ilé ìgbọ̀nsẹ̀ láti lọ sẹ̀yọ́!"
1054,"But, it did not seem as if that trick would work anymore.",Sùgbọ́n kò fẹ́ jọ pé ọgbọ́n yẹn máa ṣiṣẹ́ mọ́.
1055,"Because only yesterday, madam cried out: Zenabu! Zenabu! Where is this mischievous little creature?",Nítorí àná alánàá ni màdáámù ṣì kígbe pé: Sènábù! Sènábù! Ibo ni èké kékeré yì wà?

1057,‘Inside the toilet as usual? What the hell is wrong with this little wretch?,"Nílé ìgbọ̀nsẹ̀, bí ó ṣe ń ṣe? Kí ni ó ń bá olòṣì kékeré yìí jà ná?"
1058,"Always in the toilet 'Nothing madam! Here I am madam!"" Zenabu had stood before her, looking at her pleadingly.","Gbogbo ìgbà ní ilé ìgbọ̀nsẹ̀ “kò sí nǹkankan Màdààmú, èmi rè é màdààmú” Sènábù dúró níwájú rẹ̀, ó ń wò pẹ̀lú ojú ẹ̀bẹ̀."
1059,"Madam's smart fingers caught Zenabis little ears, and as she uttered some obscenities shook her violently, pushing her hither and thither.","Ọwọ́ màdààmú ti yára gbá etí Sènábù kékeré mú ó sì sọ àwọn ọ̀rọ̀ ìríra sí i, ó gbò ó jìgìjìgì síbí sóhùn-ún."

1061,Soon you'll be returned to your people.,"Láìpé, wọn á dá ẹ padà fún àwọn ènìyàn rẹ̀."
1062,Give me just two or three days.,Fúnmi lọ́jọ́ méjì sí mẹ́ta.
1063,Labake let go her hands and Zenabu's body hit the floor with a thump!,"Làbákẹ́ tú ọwọ́ rẹ̀, Sènábù sì subú, gbà!."
1064,There was nobody near to tell all these to.,Kò sẹ́nikẹ́ni nítòsí láti sọ gbogbo èyí fún.
1065,"Zenabu, very much, longed for somebody to relate her experience to - a trusted person, one who would understand and pity her.","Ó wu Sènábù púpọ̀ láti rẹ́ni sọ ìrírí rẹ̀ fún - ẹni tó ṣe é fọkàn tán, ẹni tí yóò yé, tí yóò sì káàánú ẹ̀."
1066,"Imagine her joy when at last, old Mama again knocking at the door of the house.",Ẹ wòye bí ayọ̀ rẹ̀ ṣe kún tó nígbẹ̀yìn gbẹ́yín tí màmá àgbà tún kan ìlẹ̀kùn ilé yẹn.
1067,And her all alone in the house too!,Tí ó tún bá òun nìkan nílé!
1068,Mama had barely taken her seat when Zenabu's tongue started to wag like the restless tail of a dog on seeing its owner.,Màmá ò tíì jóòkó tàìjókòó ti ahọ́n Sènábù bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í gbòn bí i ti ìrù ajá tí ó ń mì tí ó bá rí olówó rẹ̀.
1069,Madam has gone mad! Zenabu announced to old Mama.,Màdáámù ti ya wèrè! Sènábù kéde fún màmá àgbà.
1070,Gone thoroughly mad! It is a great looks wild like the bush cat.,"Wọ́n ti ya wèrè gan-an! Ó ti jọ ehànnà, bí ológbò-igbó."
1071,"Her rough bushy hair has dropped carelessly over her neck, stretching to her shoulders making her look like a devil.","Irun rẹ̀ tí ó ki bí i igbó yẹn ti dà wálẹ̀ sí èjìká rẹ̀, èyí sì ń jẹ́ kí jọ èṣù."
1072,"Her finger nails are now very long and sharp, like the beak of the kingfisher.","Èékánná rẹ̀ ti wá gùn gan-an ó sì mú, à fi bí ti ẹnu ẹyẹ."
1073,There was not a day madam would not deep her long nails inside her cheeks and pull her by the ears.,Ọjọ́ kan ò lè kọjá kí màdáaḿù má ti èékánná yẹn bọ̀ ọ́ lẹ́rẹ̀kẹ́ kí ò sì fà á létí.
1074,She showed her blistered ears and swollen cheeks to Mama.,Ó fi etí àti ẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ rẹ̀ wíwú han màmá.
1075,"Madam would one day tear her to pieces, at the rate she was going, with those long, sharp nails of hers or with those snaggy iron teeth because she had become mad.","Màdáámù á sì yá á sí wẹ́wẹ́ níjọ́ kan pẹ̀lú bí ó ṣe ń lọ yìí, pẹ̀lú èékánná gígùn rẹ̀ tí ó mú yẹn tàbí eyín irin rẹ̀ yẹn nítorí ó tí ya wèrè."
1076,"Very mad, Zenabu confessed she was fed up, and would like to go back to her people at home.","Wèrè gidi, Sènábù jẹ́wọ́ pé ó ti sú òun, á sì wù òun láti padà sọ́dọ̀ àwọn ènìyàn rẹ̀ nílé."

1078,She patted the little girl on the back and told her not to worry.,"Ó fi ọwọ́ lu ọmọ náà jẹ́jẹ́ lẹ́yìn, ó sì sọ fún  un pé kí ó má ṣe dààmú."
1079,All would be well at last...,Ohun gbogbo á dára níkeyìn ...
1080,It was good Labake was running mad.,Ó dára bí Làbákẹ́ ṣe ń yí lórí.
1081,It was expected.,Ohun tí wọn ń retí ni.
1082,Mama was not surprised.,Èyí kò sì jẹ́ ìyàlẹ́nu fún màmá.
1083,Esuniyi had told her Labake would have a bitter taste of her own medicine before long.,Èṣùníyì ti sọ fún un pé Làbákẹ́ á jẹ nínú ẹ̀fọ́ ìkà tí ó ti rò kí ó tó pẹ́.
1084,"And now, it has started to happen, greater things were soon going to happen.","Ní báyìí, ó tí wá ń sẹlẹ̀, nǹkan tí ó ju èyí á tó máa sẹlẹ̀."
1085,Mama was in town to collect some of Labake's hair and her fingernails.,Irun-orí àti èékánná Làbákẹ́ ni màmá wá gbà ní ìgboro.
1086,Esuniyi needed them for further action so that Labake's final doom might be sealed.,Èṣùníyì fẹ́ lò ó láti fi túnbọ̀ ba ti Làbákẹ́ jẹ́.
1087,"It should not surprise anybody, therefore, to see Labake - probably next week or week after - run out to the streets and pitch her home in the market square under the full glare of people who had come to buy and sell.",Kò ní láti ya ẹnikẹ́ni lẹ́nu lẹ́yìn èyí láti rí Làbákẹ́ lẹ́yìn ọ̀sẹ̀ kan tàbí méjì ní àwọn òpópónà kí ó sì dúró sí gbàgede ọjà níbi tí àwọn ènìyàn tí wọn wá ṣe kárà-kátà á tí rí ìran pípé wò.

1089,"Finally, Labake would crawl on her knees, in penitence to Esuniyi's lunatic asylum.","Nígbẹ̀yìn gbẹ́yín,  Làbákẹ́ á fí orúnkún rẹ̀ ráwọ ọgbà Èsúńiyì pẹ̀lụ́ ìronúpíwàdà."
1090,"In the case of Alamu, Esuniyi had told Mama there was no cause for alarm anymore.","Ní ti Àlàmú, Èṣùníyì ti sọ fún màmá pé kò séwu lóko mọ́."
1091,Alamu's condition would start improving henceforth.,Ipò tí Àlàmú wà á máa yàtọ̀ sí dáadáa láti ìsínyì lọ.

1093,Alamu returned home and met his mother with a gay countenance.,"Àlàmú padà délé, ó sì bá ìyá rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú ìrísí tó fi inú dídùn hàn."
1094,He greeted the old woman smiling prostrating.,Ó kí ìyá náà pẹ́lù ẹ̀rín músẹ́ lẹ́nu ní ìdọ́bálè.
1095,"He was returning from an important mission to town, the outcome of which greatly cheered his spirit.","Ó ń ti ibi isẹ́ kan pàtàkì nígboro bọ̀, èyí ti àyọrísí rẹ̀ mú un dárayá."
1096,"For the first time in nine months, Alamu heaved a sigh of relief.","Fún ìgbà àkọ́kọ́ nínú oṣù mẹ́sàn-án, Àlàmú mí ìmí ìtura."
1097,"For nine whole months, he had surrounded himself with a mystery that had continued to baffle everybody; a secret that had proved impossible for anybody to decipher - except for that one man who was so dear to him - Adio his only friend.",Fún odidi oṣù mẹ́sàn-án gbáko ní ó ti yí ara rẹ̀ ká pẹ̀lú àdììtú kan tí ó rú gbogbo ènìyàn lójú; àsírí kan tí kò ṣe é ṣe fún ẹnikẹ́ni láti tú – yàtọ̀ sí ọkùnrin kan tí ó súnmọ́ ọn pẹ́kípẹ́kí - Àdìó ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ kanṣoṣo.
1098,Now the end of that mystery was in sight.,"Níbáyìí, òpin àdììtú yẹn ti wà nítòsí."
1099,"The end of his mental and physical agony was in view, the end of his madness was at hand.",Òpin sí dàrúdápò ọpọlọ àti ìrora rẹ̀ ti súnmo itòsí.
1100,He had been told to wait for only two more weeks when all his problems would be practically solved.,Wọn tí sọ fún un pé kí ó dúró fún  ọ̀sẹ̀ méjì sí i tí gbogbo ìṣòrorẹ̀ á fi yanjú pátápátá.
1101,Alamu couldn't believe his ears.,Àlàmú kò gbà etí rẹ̀ gbọ́.
1102,"Eagerly, he counted the days one, two, five, ten, fifteen...","Pẹ̀lú ìwànwara ní ó fi ń ka àwọn ọjọ́, ení, èjì, ẹ̀ta, ẹ̀rin, àrún, ẹ̀wá, mẹ́ẹ̀dógún ..."
1103,Fifteen more days! He counted the hours! The minutes!,Ọjọ́ mẹ́ẹ̀dógún sí i! Ó ń ka wákàtí! ìsẹ́jú!
1104,Adio was amused at Alamu's show of thrill and excitement.,Ó jẹ́ ìyàlenu fún Àdìó bí Àlàmú ṣe ń ṣe àfihàn ìrusókè ìdùnnú rẹ̀.
1105,"Well, two weeks more they say and judgment would be delivered?","Bẹ́ẹ̀, ọ̀sẹ̀ méjì sì ni wọ́n sọ, ìdájọ́ á sì wáyé?"
1106,That was too short a time compared with the nine months that he'd been waiting.,Ìyẹn kéré púpọ̀ níye sí oṣù mẹ́sàn-án tí ó ti fi ń dúró.
1107,Was he going to cry or was he going to smile after a fortnight?,"Ṣé yóò sunkún ni, tàbí yóò rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́ lẹ́yìn ọ̀sẹ̀ méjì?"
1108,He'd been told he would smile.,Wọn tisọ fún  un pé á rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́.
1109,Everything pointed to the fact that he would smile.,Gbogbo nǹkan ló sì tọ́ka sí i dájúdájú pé yóò rẹ́rìn –ín músẹ́.
1110,"So, it was just proper that he should start smiling from now on, in hope and optimism.","Fún ìdí èyí, ó tó kí ó kúkú bẹ̀rẹ̀ sí i rẹ́rìn- ín músẹ́ láti ìsìnyí nínú ìrètí áti ìgbàgbọ́ pé gbogbo nǹkan a sìse fún rere."
1111,That was why he now met his old mother with a dazzling natural smile...,Ìdí nìyí tí ó fi fi ẹ̀rín músẹ́ tó rí yan-ran yan-ran kọ mọ̀nà pàdé ìyá rẹ̀...
1112,"Mama watched her son, and her heart sang for joy.","Màmá ń wo ọmọ rẹ̀, ọkàn rẹ̀ sì kọrin fáyọ̀."
1113,Here was her son now smiling at her and responding normally to questions and discussions.,Ọmọ rẹ̀ wa rè é tó ń rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́ sí i tí ó sì ń fèsì bí ó ṣetọ́ sí ìbéèrè àti àsọgbà ọ̀rọ̀ wọn.
1114,"What was more, Alamu politically took permission from his mother that he had other things doing in town again. He would, therefore, be going back but would not be long.","Kílótún kù, Àlàmú fi tọ̀wọ̀tọ̀wọ̀ tọrọ ìyọ̀ǹda lọ́wọ́ ìyá rẹ̀ pé òun ṣì tún ní àwọn nǹkan mìíràn láti ṣe ní ìgboro. Fún ìdí èyí ó fẹ́ padà jáde ṣùgbọ́n kò níí pẹ́."
1115,Her son now had the courtesy to take permission! The first part of the job had been accomplished! God bless Esuniyi.,"Ọmọ rẹ̀ ti wá ńi ìbuyì fún un, láti gbà ààyè! Apá kìíní iṣ́e náà ti parí! Á dáa fún Èṣùníyì."
1116,Mama waited patiently for Labake to return.,Màmá dúró pẹ̀lú sùúrù pé kí Làbákẹ́ dé.
1117,"And when she saw her approaching from a distance, she quickly rummaged through the basket she brought from the district and took out a small bottle inside which she kept the herbalist's concoction.","Nígbà tí ó sì rí i tí ó ń bọ̀ lọ́ọ̀ọ́kán, ó tètè tú apẹ̀rẹ̀ tí ó gbé wá láti ìgbèríko, ó sì mú ìgò kékeré tí ó tọ́jú òògùn babaláwo rẹ̀ sí."
1118,She'd been properly briefed by Esunivi on how she would apply it.,Èṣùníyì ti sọ bí ó ṣe máa lò ó fún un.
1119,"So, now, she staggered towards the doorstep of Labake's room and sprinkled the concoction, in a straight line.","Nísìnyí, ó ta gbọ̀n-ọ́n gbọ̀n-ọ́n sẹ́nu ọ̀nà yàrá Làbáké, ó sì wọn òògùn náà sílẹ̀ sórí ìlà tẹ́ẹ́rẹ́ kan."
1120,It was important that Labake should walk across it as she entered her so that she might be more violently possessed both mind and body.,Ó se pàtàkì kí Làbákẹ́ dá a kọjá bí ó bá ti ń wọ yàrá rẹ̀ kí tiẹ̀ lè túbọ̀ bá a ní tọkàn-tarà.
1121,"After sprinkling the preparation, Mama turned round and round five times according to the herbalist's instructions.","Lẹ́yìn tí ó bá ti wọn òògùn náà tán, Màmá yípo yípo lẹ́ẹ̀marùn-ún gẹ́gẹ́bí babaláwo rẹ̀ ṣe la kalẹ̀."
1122,"But as she was starting on the fourth round, Labake entered, watching the old woman, mouth agape.","Bí ó ṣe wà lórí ẹ̀ẹ̀kẹ́rin, Làbákẹ́ wọlé, ó ń wo ìyá àgbà náà, pẹ̀lú ẹnu rẹ̀ ní lílà sílẹ̀."
1123,"Mama stood for a while, nodded in reply to Labake's greetings and then leaned against the wall facing Labake's room, muttering to herself, several times, the short incantatory sentence she'd been asked to recite on first seeing Labake.","Màmá dúró fún ìgbà díẹ̀, kanrí mọ́lẹ̀ ní èsì kíkí Làbákẹ́ ó sì fẹ̀yìntì ògiri tí ó kọjú sí ògiri yàrá Làbákẹ́, ó ń sọ àwọn ìpèdé tí wọn ní kó pè tí ó bá ti fojú gán-án-ni Làbákẹ́ sí ara rẹ̀ láìmoye ìgbà."
1124,"At the end of it all, Mama laughed.","Ní òpin gbogbo rẹ̀, màmá bú sẹ́rìn-ín."
1125,"Labake's appearance was indeed wild, it was even more terrible than Zenabu had described it.","Ìrísí Làbákẹ́ jọ ti ẹhànnà gidi, ó tiẹ̀ tún banilẹ́rù ju bí Sènábù ti ṣàpèjúwe rẹ̀."
1126,Labake had really gone mad now - the way she looked like some dreadful monster from inside an old cave poised for rampage!,"Làbákẹ́ ti wá ya wèrè gidi báyìí – bí ó ṣe rí, ó dàbí i ewèlè tí ó wá láti inú ihò àpáta tí ó ti ṣetán ìjà!"
1127,Her bushy hair dangled over her neck and shoulders and hid part of her face.,"Irun rẹ̀ tí ó dàbí i igbó dà wálẹ̀ sọ́rùn àti èjìká rẹ̀, ó sì bo apá ibìkan lójú rẹ̀."
1128,"The hair... yes, that was one of the items she'd come for.","Irun yẹn ... bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, ọ̀kan lára àwọn nǹkan ti ìyá wá wá rè é."
1129,"Before leaving for the district later in the day, she had to ensure that a sizeable lock of that hair was cut and kept away inside her basket.","Kí ó tó máa lọ sí ìgbéríko ní ìrọ̀lẹ́, ó gbọ́dò rí i pé ó rí èyí tó tó wọ̀n nínú irun náà gé kí ó sì tọ́jú rẹ̀ sínú apẹ̀rẹ̀ rẹ̀."
1130,"Then, Labake's long finger nails, her red, long nails.","Lẹ́yìn náà ní èékáná gígùn ọwọ́ Làbákẹ́, èékán gígùn pupa rè."
1131,That was one other item she'd come to fetch.,Ìyen tún ní nǹkan tí ó wá mú.
1132,Mama's eyes roamed from Labake's black hair to her red nails for some time.,Ojú màmá ń wo láti irun orí Làbákẹ́ dúdú dé èékaná pupa rẹ̀ fún ìgbà díẹ̀.
1133,Finally she looked Labake straight in the face and said;,"Nígbẹ̀yìn, ó wo Làbákẹ́ tààrà ó sì ní;"
1134,"""Hem... Hem... Hem!"" she cleared her throat, ""Hem... You. You are still here?""","""Ẹm Ẹm Ẹm!"", ó kọ́kọ́ tún ọ̀nà òfun rẹ̀ ṣe. ""Ẹm.…Ìwọ. Ìwọ sì wá níbí?"""

1136,"""Me?"", Labake asked.","""Ṣé èmi?"", Làbákẹ́ bèèrè."
1137,She entered her room crossing Mama's border! Falling into Mama's laid down trap! The herbalist's trap!,Ó wọ yàrá rẹ̀ lọ ní dídá ibòdè màmá kọjá! Ó kó sínú páńpẹ́ màmá! Páńpẹ́ babaláwo!
1138,"And in a minute, she rushed out of her room again and confronted Mama, wearing a murderous look. ""I am now listening!""","Ní ìṣẹ́jú kan, ó kù gìrì jáde láti inú yàrá rẹ̀, ó dójúkọ màmá pẹ̀lú ìwò tí ó lè pànìyàn lójú rẹ̀. ""Mo ti ń gbọ́ báyìí!"""

1158,Labake stood breathing heavily on Mama.,"Làbákẹ́ dúró, ó ń mí lókèlókè lé màmá."
1159,"A sentence more from Mama even a word more, and Labake would have hauled herself on the old woman and sent her grave before the appointed time.","Bí màmá bá sọ gbólóhùn kan sí i, bó bá sọ ẹyọ ọ̀rọ̀ kan,  Làbákẹ́ ò bá ti bò ìyá àgbà  náà, á sì rán an lọ sí sàréè láìtó ọjọ́."
1160,"Mama smiled, and tactfully withdrew.","Màmá rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́, ó sì fi ọgbọ́n ẹ̀wẹ́ jáwọ́."
1161,"She was not annoyed, not annoyed at all.","Kò bínú, kò bínú rárá."
1162,Labake was already under a spell.,Òògùn ló ń sisẹ́ lára Làbákẹ́.
1163,Labake had literally dug her own grave now that she had crossed the concoction line across the doorstep of her own room.,Làbákẹ́ ti gbẹ́ kòtò ara rẹ̀ nísìnyí tí ó ti dá ìlà òògùn kọjá lẹnú ọ̀nà yàrá rẹ̀.
1164,"What remained for her to do was to literally put Labake inside the prepared coffin, nail the coffin, and bury it inside the deep earth.","Ohun tí ó kàn kù fún un ní kí ó gbé Làbákẹ́ sínú pósí, kí ó kàn án pa, kí ó sì sín-in sínú ilẹ̀ tí ó gbẹ́."

1169,Never come to town again.,Má wà sí ìgboro mọ́ láé.
1170,You hear that hag!,Ṣóogbọ́ bẹ́ yẹn àjẹ́!
1171,"Mama did not utter a word in reply, rather she was smiling, she knew what was happening.","Màmá ò fèsì ọ̀rọ̀ kan, kàkà bẹ́ẹ̀ ń ṣe ló ń rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́, ó mọ̀ ohun tó ń sẹlẹ̀."
1172,Labake was mad now.,Làbákẹ́ ti ya wèrè báyìí.
1173,"Thoroughly mad. Just as Esuniyi had said, so she would not give a single reply, very soon, Labake would pack to her new home in the market square. So, let the tirade continue: Go on!","Wèrè sán-ún sán-ún.

1175,You couldn't be tired yet! Let the tirade continue by all means!,Kò tí ì yẹ kí ó rẹ̀ ẹ́! Ó gbọ́dọ̀ jẹ́ kí ó tẹ̀síwájú lọ́nàkonà!
1176,"After some five minutes, there was quiet Mama winked at Zenabu; silently and knowingly, the little girl nodded her head back.","Ìdákẹ́rọ́rọ́ wà lẹ́yìn ìsẹ́jú márùn-ún, màmá sẹ́jú sí Sènábù; kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́ náà ní ọmọbìnrin kékeré náà kanrí mọ́lẹ̀ padà."
1177,She had grown so much used to Mama now that communication between them had become quite easy.,Ó ti mọwọ́ màmá tó bẹ́ẹ̀ tí ìbánisọ̀rọ̀ ti wá rọrùn láàrin wọn.
1178,"Labake, after working herself up, setting her own body ablaze went inside the bathroom to have a cold shower and swiftly, Zenabu moved into action.","Lẹ́yìn tí ó ti dá ara rẹ̀ láàmú, tí ó ti gbé ẹ̀mí ara rẹ̀ gbóná Làbákẹ́ gbọ̀nà balùwẹ̀ lọ láti sanra pẹ̀lú omi tútù, ní kíá sì ni Sènábù bẹ̀rẹ̀ isẹ́"
1179,"She was not a stranger to madam’s bedroom, she knew all the nooks and corners of things included in the room.","Kì í ṣe àjèjì sí yàrá màdáámù, gbogbo ibi kọ́lọ́fín àti ikòrògún yàrá náà ni ó mọ̀."

1181,"And now that madam had neatly packed, it was all the more easy for Zenabu to locate the two items she was looking for. Under three minutes, she had finished the assignment and she came out of madam's room clutching the two items, neatly wrapped up inside an old paper, and smiling at Mama.","Nìsínyí tí màdáámù ti fẹ́rẹ̀ ẹ́ kó ẹrù rẹ̀ tán, ó rọrùn fún un láti rí àwọn nǹkan méjì tí ó wà.

1182,Mama got the piece of paper and quickly tucked it away inside her basket.,Màmá gbà á ó sì tètè fi sínú apẹ̀rẹ̀ rẹ̀.
1183,"When finally Labake emerged from inside the bathroom, what she saw was little Zenabu playing with Tinu on the corridor, and Mama bidding  Alamu who had just come in goodbye promising to check back on him before the end of that week.","Nígbà ti màdáámù jáde láti inú balùwè, ohun tí ó rí nípé Sènábù kékeré ń bá Tinú seré lẹ́nu ọ̀nà, màmá sì ń dágbére fún Àlàmú tó sẹ̀sẹ̀ ń wọlé dé, tí wọn sí ń ṣe ìlérí láti wá wò ó kí ó to di òpin ọ̀ṣẹ̀ náà."
1184,The two items were secure inside her basket.,Àwọn nǹkan méjì náà wà ní ìpamó nínú apẹ̀rẹ̀ rẹ̀.
1185,"Mama had stolen a look at the two items herself, and had been very much pleased: four of Labake's long red nails which she pointed at her a short while ago and which she had removed as she Chtered the room.","Màmá ti jí àwọn nǹkan náà wò nínú apẹ̀rẹ̀ rẹ̀, ó sì tẹ ẹ lọ́rùn; mẹ́rin nínú èékánná pupa ọwọ́ Làbákẹ́ tí ó fi nawọ sí i láìpẹ́ yìí, tí ó yọ nígbà tí ó wọ yàrá."
1186,"Her false nails! Then Labakes Small lock of hair, which some minutes ago had boen dangling over her body and which she had removed as she prepared to go to the bathroom, her wig!","Èékán-ná ayédèrú!

1188,"The time was near, when Labake would run of the house into the streets naked: when she would pitch her home at the market square, when she would crawl on her knees to Esuniyi's camp in the isolated area of the forest in the district!","Àsìkò náà ti súnmọ́, ti Làbákẹ́ á sáré jáde nínú ilé níhòòhò wọ òpópónà: ìgbà tí ó máa ṣo gbàgede ọjà di ilé, ìgbàtí á rákò lórí orúnkún rẹ̀ wọ ọgbà Èṣùníyì tí ó wà ní agbèègbè ìyàsọ́tọ̀ nínú igbó ìgbèriko."

1190,"Alamu's condition had improved, Alamu would not suffer the indignity of having his head shaved. He would not suffer the humiliation of being thrown inside the dark room of the mad house with those eccentric inmates velling and hooting.","Ipò Àlàmú ti yàtọ̀, kò ní i kan àbùkù orí fífọ́ mọ́.

1206,That was a common feature of Esuniyi's enclave.,Èyí ni àbùdá àhámọ́ Èṣùníyì kan.
1207,"No doubt, his people were at their game their, usual game.","Láìsí àní-àní, àwọn èèyàn rẹ̀ ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ eré ìje wọn bí wọ́n ṣe máa ń ṣe."
1208,The usual physical attack one another had probably started again.,Ìjà tí wọ́n máa ń já fún  ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ níyẹn.
1209,"Each time they started it, it was usually like hell itself breaking loose.","Nígbàkugbà tí wọ́n bá si bẹ̀rẹ̀, gbẹgẹdẹ máa ń gbiná."
1210,"They would pounce on one another, like rabies-infected dogs and snap and smack and tear.","Wọn á bo ara wọn bí i ajá ọlọ́kúnr̀un, wọn á lu ara wọn, wọn á tún ya arà wọn jẹ."
1211,The lunatics yelling noise drowned Mama's voice.,Ariwo àwọn wèrè náà mú ohùn màmá wálẹ̀.
1212,Mama had started appealing passionately to the medicine man to use all his power to eliminate Labake as quickly as possible - today or tomorrow.,"Màmá ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í bẹ Bàbá olóògùn pẹ̀lú ìtara, pé kí ó lọ gbogbo agbára rẹ̀ láti yanjú Làbákẹ́ ní kíákíá – lónìí sọ́la."
1213,Bring her down to her knees.,Kí ó mú un wálẹ̀ lórí orúnkún rẹ̀.
1214,"Cause the other invisible enemies of her son to wander naked into the thick jungle where hyenas and leopards would be waiting to launch a fierce attack on them, that was what she wanted.","Kí ó jẹ́ kí àwọn ọ̀tá ọmọ rẹ̀ yòókù tí ò ṣe é́ fojú rí rìn lọ níhòòhò sinú igbó kìjikìji tí ìkòkò àti àmọ̀tẹ́kùn á ti máa dúró láti dojú kọ wọ́n, ohun tí Màmá fẹ́ nìyẹn."
1215,That was what she was telling Esuniyi to do when the noise from the lunatics came on more and more compellingly.,Nǹkan tí ó ń sọ fún Èṣùníyì pé kí ó ṣe nìyẹn tí ariwo àwọn wèrè yẹn fi tún pọ̀ sí i.
1216,"Esuniyi stood up abruptly, he raced towards the direction of the noise.","Èṣùníyì dìde gírí, ó sáré sọ́na ibi tí ariwo  náà ti ń wá."
1217,"In a minute, he ran back again.","Láàárín ìṣẹ́jú kan, ó ti sárẹ padà."
1218,He rushed inside an inner room in his own Apartment.,Ó sáré wọ yàrá kan nínú iyẹwù tirẹ̀.
1219,He came out circling a long whip over head.,Ó jáde pẹ̀lú àtòrì kan tí ó ká yí orí rẹ̀.
1220,"His eyes bulged. The veins stood out in single layers over his strong arms, his lips trembled, his body shook with anger and emotion.","Ojú rẹ̀ ràn. Isan dá dúró lọ́tọ̀ ní ọwọ́ rẹ̀ líle, ètè rẹ̀ ń gbọ̀n, ara rẹ̀ ń gbọ̀n pẹ̀lú ìbínú àti ìmí-ẹ̀dùn."
1221,"At nomal times, Esubiyi would look innocent and calm, talking slowly, quickly, camestly.","Ní àwọn ìgbà tó ṣe gẹ́gẹ́, Èṣùníyì máa ń tutù, á jọ aláìsẹ̀, ara rẹ̀ balẹ̀, á máa sọ̀rọ̀ díẹ̀díẹ̀, láìpariwo pẹ̀lú ìfọ̀kansì."
1222,"He would smile gently, looking you straight in the face as he spoke.","Á rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́ jẹ́jẹ́, á máa wojú yín bí ó ṣe ń sọ̀rọ̀."
1223,"He was then like any other man, every other man like you and me.","Nígbà yẹn ó dàbí i gbogbo ọkùnrin, bí ọkùnrin gidi bí ìwọ àti èmi."
1224,"But on such occasions as this, when this camp was in pandemonium, Esuniyi was a completely different man.","Sùgbọ́n lẹ́ẹ̀kọ̀ọ̀kan báyìí, ti yán-pọn-yán-rin bá wà nínú àgọ́ yì, Èṣùníyì máa ń di ọkùnrin àrà ọ̀tọ̀."
1225,"He would bark out orders, his voice roaring like a clap of thunder. He was a man of great strength and physique.","Á pariwo àsẹ rẹ̀, pẹ̀lú ohùn rẹ̀ tí ó ń búramú-ramù bí àtẹ́wó ààrá. Ó jẹ́ òkùnrin tí ó kúnfún okun ńlá àti ìrísí."
1226,He would grab his victim with the viciousness of an octopus and the ferocity of a tiger.,A gbá ẹni tí ó ṣè mú pẹ̀lú ìwà èérí àti ìrorò ẹkùn.
1227,The strong muscles of his arms would become tense and straighten up.,"Iṣan apá rẹ̀ á yi, á wá le koko."
1228,The bones would screech  almost cracking.,"Egungun rẹ̀ á nà, á fẹ́rẹ̀ ẹ́ lè kán."
1229,His victim would let forth a fearful yelp and recoil immediately in total submission like the trampled millipede.,"Ẹni tí ó gbá mú náà á pariwo ìbẹ̀rù, á sì padà sẹ́yìn pẹ̀lú ìjọ̀wọ́ pátápátá bí i ti ọ̀ọ̀kùn tí ati ra mọ́lẹ̀."
1230,"Apart from the use of physical force, Esubiyi had other methods.","Yàtọ̀ sí ti ipá ojú kó-ojú, Èṣùníyì ní àwọn ìlànà mìíràn."
1231,"You would see him holding his blood-stained antelope horn high up in the air, addressing the four elements - the controllers of human destiny - invoking the invisible spirit of the air to work on the boiling nerves of the lunatics and restore them to order.","Wà á rí i tí ó di ìwo ẹtù rẹ̀ ti ẹ̀jẹ̀ ti yí mú sókè nínú afẹ́fẹ́, á máa bá àwọn àwòmọ́ mẹ́rin ayé sọ̀rọ̀, àwọn adarí kádàrá ẹ̀dá – ó ń perí àwọn ẹ̀mí inú afẹ́fẹ́ láti sisẹ́ nínú iṣan gbígbóná àwọn wèrè náà kí ara wọn lè wálẹ̀."
1232,"And it would be so, if only momentarily.","Ó sì máa ri bẹ́ẹ̀, bí ó tilẹ̀ jẹ́ fún ìgbà díẹ̀."
1233,"But now, it was the ""wham-wham-wham! method.","Sùgbọ́n nísìnyí, ìlànà wámú-wámú-wámú ni ó fẹ́ lò."
1234,"For over five minutes, Mama heard the lashing sound of the whip over human bodies and shrank.","Fúnbí ì ìsẹ́jú márùn-ún, Màmá ń gbọ́ ohùn àtòrì lára àwọn ènìyàn ara rẹ̀ sì súnkì."
1235,This was truly no ordinary place.,Ibí yìí kì í ṣe ibi lásán rárá.
1236,"At the end of his punitive step, Esuniyi retumed to Mama with the composure of a normal human being, a serene look, once again, on his face.","Ní òpin ìgbésẹ̀ ìfìyà-jẹ̀nìyàn rẹ, Èṣùníyì padà lọ bá màmá pẹ̀lú ìkórajo ènìyàn tí ó pé, pẹ̀lú ojú ọmọlúàbí lẹ́ẹ̀kan sí i."

1239,"Otherwise, the Lunatics themselves would take over the control of the mad house.","Bí bẹ́ẹ̀kọ́, àwọn wèrè fúnrawọn náà ágbàjọba ilé náà."
1240,"Otherwise, they would turn the place into a battlefield.","Bí bẹ́ẹ̀kọ́, wọn á sọ ibẹ̀ di pápá ogun."
1241,Otherwise they would attack himself one day and chase him out of his house. They can even kill him.,"Bí bẹ́ẹ̀kọ́ wọn a dojúkọ Èṣùníyì lọ́jọ kan, wọn á sì lé e jáde kúrò nínú ọgbà rẹ̀. Wọn tún lè pá a"

1243,There was nothing they would not do once law and order broke down.,Kò sí nǹkan tí wọn ó le ṣe tí òfin àti àsẹ bá dàrú.
1244,Mama heaved a sigh of relief.,Màmá mí ìmí ìtura.
1245,She had cause to be Thankful to God.,Ò ní ìdí láti máa fọpẹ́ fún Elédúmàrè.

1247,"What would she do if it was her son that was now standing, half naked, under that tree, some yards away, pointing at nothing and talking to the empty air?","Kí ni ìbá ṣe kání ọmọ rẹ̀ ní ó dúró lábẹ́ igi ọ̀kánkán yẹn, tí ó ti fẹ́rẹ̀ ẹ́ já sí ìhòòhò tán, tí ó ń nawọ́ sí nǹkan tí ò sí, tí ó sì ń bá afẹ́fẹ́ òfìfo sọ̀rọ̀?"

1250,Esuniyi watched Mama and noticed the grim look of concern over her countenance,"Èṣùníyì wo màmá, ó sì ṣàkíyèsí ìkorò tó wá lójú rẹ̀."
1251,"Mama, there is no cause for fear.","Màmá, kò sí ìdí fún ìbẹ̀rù."

1253,The whole job is as good as finished.,Gbogbo isẹ́ náà ti fẹ́rẹ̀ ẹ́ parí.

1258,"Yes, he must be here himself, personally.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, ó ní láti wà níbí, fúnrarẹ̀."

1272,It was a task she must perform.,Ó jẹ́ isẹ́ tí ó gbọ́dọ̀ ṣe.

1301,She would pursue him herself.,Màmá fúnrarẹ̀ á lé e mú.

1303,"Chasing him to the bank of river Akokura, appealing to him to come back. begging him, before he would cross that river.","Tí ó ń lé e lọ sọ́nà etí odò Akókurà, tí ó bẹ̀ẹ́ pé kí ó padà, tí ó ń bẹ́ẹ̀ kí ó tó di wí pé ó kọjá odò náà."
1304,Before he would cross the Rubicon.,Kí ó tó di wí pé ó kọjá ibi tí kò ti ní lè padà.

1306,He should not cross any river - or else... She imagined her son still hurrying away.,"Kò gbọdọ̀ kọjá odò kankan, bí bẹ́ẹ̀ kọ́... Ó ń wòye bí ọmọ rẹ̀ ṣe ń kánjú lọ."
1307,"The mighty power of the enemies was upon him, pushing him, pushing him, making him resist all attempt to bring sanity back.

1309,"Nothing is wrong with me! I have business to do in town, so, I am hurrying away!","Nǹkan ò ṣe mí! Mo ní iṣẹ́ tí mo fẹ́ ṣe ní ìgboro, mo tètè ń lọ!"
1310,"Mama imagined herself launching a grip, a firm grip on him, a 'kill-me-now, kill-me-now' grip.","Màmá tún wòye ara rẹ̀ bí ó ṣe gbá a mú, ó gba mú gírí-gírí, ìgbámú 'pamí-nísìnyí, pamí nísìnyí'."
1311,"Esuniyi laughed, Mama sat straight, waking up suddenly from her momentary dream.","Èṣùníyì rẹ́rìn-ín, Màmá jókòó sára, ó déédé tají lójú àlá àsìkò tí ó ń lá."

1314,"""Your son will not refuse coming to the district Mama"". Esunyi said, I'll go with you to bring him.","Màmá, ọmọ yín ò ní kọ̀ láti wá sí abúlé'. Èṣùníyì sọ, Màá tẹ̀lé yín lọ láti mú un wá."
1315,He will gladly follow us.,Tayọ̀tayọ̀ ló máa fi tẹ̀lé wa.
1316,"Don't worry Mama, I'll just pop into their house for a minute or two.","Ẹ má da ara yín láàḿu màmá, màá kàn yọ fóró sínú ilé wọn fún bí ìsẹ́jú kan sí méjì."
1317,"Our eyes would be four, and that's all. I'll rush back to the district and he'll follow later,  probably that same day or the following day.","Ojú wa á ṣe mẹ́rin, o dẹ ma tan sibẹ.

1318,"Mama heaved a heavy sigh again, she had implicit confidence in the powers of the medicine man.","Màmá tún mí kanlẹ̀, ó ní ìgbẹkẹ̀lé tó dúró gírí nínú agbára bàbá olóògùn."

1320,"So, she left for the village with a feeling of relief.","Fún ìdí èyí, ó gbọ̀nà abúlé lọ, pẹ̀lú ìtura lọ́kàn rẹ̀."
1321,"There was one vacant room inside Mama's mud building in the village where Alamu could put up, if need be, when finally they succeeded in bringing to the district.","Yàrá òfìfo wà nínú ilé alámọ̀ Màmá níbi tí Àlàmú  lè dúró sí, bí ó bá nílò, lẹ́yìn tí ó bá ti jàjà ṣàṣeyọ́rí nínú mímú un wá si abúlé."
1322,He did not have to return In the same day.,Kò nílò láti padà sí ìgboro ní ọjọ́  náà.
1323,Esuniyi might want him to stay over.,Èṣùníyì lè fẹ́ kí ó sùn mọ́jú.
1324,"In that case, Alamu could come to the village and stay the night.","Fún ìdí ìyẹn, Àlàmú lè wá sí Abúlé kí ó sì sùn mọ́jú ọjọ́ kejì."
1325,"Mama set about putting the vacant room in good order instantly, she brushed down the cobwebs and chased away the geckos and cockroaches.","Màmá bẹ̀rẹ̀ sì í tún yàrá náà ṣe lẹ́sẹ̀kẹsẹ̀, ó gbọn gbogbo jàǹkárìwọ̀ sílẹ̀, ó sì lé àwọn ááyán àti ọmọ-onílé lọ."
1326,"She sprinkled water on the floor and started sweeping it, she sneezed for the umpteenth time, her head rang like a bell.","Ó wọ́n omi sílẹ̀, ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í gba a, ó ń sín láìmoye ìgbà, orí rẹ̀ ń ró bí agogo."
1327,"She blew her nose, water came from her eyes and she went deaf for a minute.","Ó fún imú rẹ̀, omi jáde lójú rẹ̀, etí rẹ̀ di fún ìsẹ́jú kan."
1328,"Later when she yawned, the doors of her ears flung open and the trapped air rushed out of them, again she sneezed.","Nígbà tó yá ti ó yán, ìlèkùn inú eti rẹ̀ ṣí gbayawu, atẹ́gùn tó ti há síbẹ̀ sá jadé ó tún sín."
1329,Life was all suffering.,Ìjìyà gbá à ní ayé jẹ́.
1330,That was even more so with Mama.,Bí ó ṣe rí fún màmá gan-an rè é.
1331,"She'd suffered, probably like no other woman had ever suffered before.","Ó ti jìyà, irú ìyà ti obìnrin kankan ò jẹ rí."
1332,"Four times in her life, she lost her pregnancy. Two before Alamu and two after him.",Ẹ̀ẹ̀mẹ́rin ní ayé rẹ̀ ni oyún ti bàjẹ́ mọ́ ọn lára. Méjì kí ó tó bí Àlàmú àti méjì mìíràn lẹ́yìn Àlàmú.
1333,"Then she couldn't become pregnant again, then she reached menopause.","Lẹ́yìn náà kò lè lóyún mọ́, ó wọ iye ọjọ́ orí tí kò ti lè ṣabiyamọ mọ́."
1334,Alamu remained her only child.,Àlàmú  nìkan lọmọ kan ṣoṣo tí ó ṣẹ́kù fún un.
1335,"When about ten years ago, her son went to the white man's country, Mama felt she had lost the battle to cure permanent happiness in life.","Níbí i ọdún mẹ́wàá sẹ́yìn, tí ọmọ rẹ̀ lọ sí ìlú Òyìnbó, Màmá rò wí pé ogun wíwá ayọ̀ ayérayé ti borí rẹ̀."
1336,It was as if Alamu had gone on a jourmey of no return.,Ń ṣe ní ó dàbí ẹni pé Àlàmú  ti rìn ìrìnàjò àrèmabọ̀.
1337,Mama was virtually left alone in the world.,Màmá nìkan ló dàbí ẹni pé ó kù láyé.
1338,"Her only ""garment' had been literally stripped off her.","""Aṣọ"" rẹ̀ kanṣoṣo ní wọn ti bọ́ lára rẹ̀."
1339,And she stood naked.,Ó wá wà ní ògòlòǹto.
1340,Life lost its colour and radiance.,Ayé ti pàdánù àwọ̀ àti ẹwà rẹ̀.
1341,"Alamu's father who could have provided the much-needed support and assurance for her had broken down in health and later died whispering the name of his son, Mama became visibly shaken mentally and emotionally, thereafter.","Bàbá Àlàmú tí ì bá ṣe alátìlẹ́yìn àti olùfọ kàntán ti dùbúlẹ̀ àìsàn tí ò sí jẹ orúkọ ọmọ rẹ̀ lẹ́nu títí ó fi ku, èyí gbo màmá dé ọpọlọ àti ìmọ̀lára lẹ́yìn ìgbà  náà."
1342,"It was true they often read Alamu's letters to her hearing, letting her know Alamu was alive.","Òótọ́ ni pé wọn máa ń ka lẹ́tà Àlàmú sí eti ìgbọ́ rẹ̀, láti fi jẹ́ kí ó mọ̀ pé Àlàmú ṣì wà láàyè."
1343,Still Mama would not believe.,"Ṣùgbọ́n síbẹ̀síbẹ̀, Màmá ò gbàgbọ́."
1344,"She would close her eyes and listen to the soothing words contained in Alamu's letter. He was hale and hearty, doing well in his studies, he was there in the cold land struggling to secure a better future for himself and Mama, very soon he would be coming back home to join her.","Á dijú rẹ̀, á sì tẹ́tí sí àwọn ọ̀rọ̀ ìtura tó wà nínú lẹ́tà Àlàmú.

1345,"Mama should take heart, stay alive and continue to pray for him.","Kí Màmá mọ́kàn, kí ó wà láàyè kí ó si tẹ̀síwájú láti máa gbàdúrà fún un."
1346,"""Your ever loving son - Alamu"".","""Ọmọ yín onífẹ̀ẹ́ òótọ́ – Àlàmú """
1347,Mama would open her eyes and muse to herself in disbelief.,"Màmá á lajú rẹ̀, á sì ṣàṣàrò sí ara rẹ̀ ni àìgbàgbọ́."
1348,Could all these be true really?,Ṣe gbogbo èyí lè jẹ́ òtítọ́ ṣá?
1349,All these might just be a mere sweet dream.,Gbogbo èyí lè jẹ́ àlá dídùn lásán.
1350,Or the trick of some good people who did not want her inside the grave too soon.,Tàbíkí ó jẹ́ ète àwọn èèyàn dáadáa kan tí kò fẹ́ kí ó wọ sàréè láìtọ́jọ́.
1351,"Those who did not want her to die of loneliness, who then had to console her with letters allegedly written by her son.","Àwọn tí kò fẹ kí ó ku ikú àdágbé, tí wọn sì ní láti tù ú lọ́kàn pẹ̀lú lẹ́tà tí wọn ní ọmọ rẹ́ kọ."
1352,"The son she knew, deep down in her heart had gone on a journey of no return.","Ọmọ rẹ̀ tí ó mọ̀, lọ́kàn ara rẹ̀ ti lọ sí ìrìnàjò àrèmabọ̀."
1353,"Lost forever, after waiting eight years in vain for Alamu's return, there was no other conclusion Mama could draw.","Ó ti sọnù títí láé, lẹ́yìn tí ó tí dúró ìdúró asán fún ọdún mẹ́jọ fún ìpàdabọ̀ Àlàmú, kò sí ìpinnu mìíràn tí màmá lè ní."
1354,And that explained why the old woman gazed at her son in wonder and incredulity the day he finally arrived back in the country from England.,Ìyẹn ni ó sì sàlàyé ìdí tí ìyá àgbà náà ṣe wo ọmọ rẹ̀ ni ìwò ìyanu àti àìgbàgbọ́ ní ọjọ́ tí ó jàjà padà sílé láti ìlú England.
1355,"That explained why, for a whole week after, Mama kept asking herself whether the healthy looking Vivacious young man was really Alamu or his ghost.","Ìyẹn sàláyé ìdí, tí màmá fi ń bí ara rẹ̀ bóyá ọmọkùnrin tí o dá ṣáṣá yìí ni Àlàmú, tàbí òkú rẹ̀ ni fún odidi ọ̀sẹ̀ kan gbáko."
1356,"And she called him by all his names - all the affectionate names he gave him during childhood, several times each day for one whole week.","Ó sì ń pè é ní gbogbo orúkọ rẹ̀ - gbogbo àwọn orúkọ tókúnfún ìfẹ́ tí ó ń pè é nígbà kékeré, láì mọyè ìgbà lọ́jọ́ kọ̀ọ̀kan fún odidi ọ̀ṣẹ̀ kan."
1357,"It was the climax of her joy, such joyous period would came back again to Mama. Life was one long chain of suffering. No end to it.","Ó jẹ ṣónṣó ayọ̀ rẹ̀, irú ìgbà ayọ̀ bẹ́ẹ̀ ò padà dè bá Màmá mọ́. Ilé ayé jẹ́ ṣẹkẹ́ṣẹkẹ̀ ìyà gígùn kan. Tí kò lópin."
1358,It was a continuous event.,Ó jẹ́ ìgbésẹ̀ tí ó ń tẹ̀síwájú.
1359,Mama thought the end of suffering had come with the return of her son.,Màmá rò ó wí pé òpin ìjìyà òun ti dé nígbà ti ọmọ rẹ̀ dé.
1360,"But precisely two years after Alamu's retum, a heartache of a different dimension took possession of Mama.","Ṣùgbọ́n kété tí ó pé ọdún méjì lẹ́yìn ti Àlàmú dé, ìbànújẹ́ tí ó gbọ̀nà àràmìíràn yọ ló tún dé bá Màmá."
1361,"A heartache which gave her several sleepless nights, which made her have several dreadful dreams, which made her breasts twitch several times, and which now made her a regular visitor to the herbalist's asylum.","Ìbànújẹ́ tí ó fún un ni ọ̀pọ̀lọpọ̀ àìroóorún-sùn òru, tí ó jẹ́ kí ó máa lá àìmọye àlákàlàá, ti ó ń jẹ́ kí omú rẹ̀ máa já pàtì láì mọyè ìgbà, tí ó wá sọ ọ́ di àlejò gbogbo ìgbà sí ọgbà babaláwo."
1362,All for love of the child.,"Gbogbo èyí, fún ìfẹ́ ọmọ."
1363,It was not possible to fathom the depth of a mother's suffering over the child.,Kò ṣeé ṣe láti mọ̀ ìjìnlẹ̀ ìyà ìyá lórí ọmọ.
1364,That's one reason the mother is the true owner of the child.,Èyí ni ìdí kan pàtàkì tó fi jẹ́ pé ìyá ní ó lọmọ lóòótọ́.
1365,"Mama made a desperate resolution, next time she set her eyes on Labake, the story was going to be different.","Màmá ní ìpinnu líle kan lọ́kàn rẹ̀ pé nígbà tí ó bá tún fojú kan Làbákẹ́, ìtàn náà á yàtọ̀."
1366,"She would be downright violent with her, knock her head against Labake's chest, tear at her.","Á gbé e gbóná fún un, á sẹ orí rẹ̀ mọ́ Làbákẹ́ láyà, á ya á jẹ."
1367,She would not wait for that slow vengeance of the herbalist anymore.,Kòní í dúró de ẹ̀san díẹ̀díẹ̀ ti babaláwo yẹn mọ́.
1368,"The day she met Labake again, perdition would come down quick and fast on her.","Lọ́jọ́ tí ó bá tún padé Làbákẹ́, á pa á run ní kíákíá."
1369,"Leave Alamu alone! she would shout on the enemies' agent, holding her by the throat, leave my son alone! My only son.","Fi Àlàmú sílẹ̀! Á pariwo lé aṣojú àwọn ọ̀tá, á dì ì lọ́fun mú “Fi ọmọ mi sílẹ̀! Ọmọ mí kan ṣoṣo."

1371,Pack your load and go now!' It is going to be an order.,"""Kó ẹrù rẹ̀ kí ó lọ nísìnyí! Á jẹ́ àṣẹ."
1372,No dialogue anymore with the enemy at home.,Kò sí ìtàkùrọsọ pẹ̀lú ọ̀tá tí ó wà nílé mọ.

1376,Mama dropped the broom she was holding and tears started trickling down her wrinkled cheeks,"Màmá jù ìgbálẹ̀ tí ó dìmú sílẹ̀, omijé bẹ̀rẹ̀ sí ṣàn wálẹ̀ lẹ́rẹ̀kẹ́ rẹ̀ tí ó ti hunjọ."
1377,"Later, she started to sob violently.","Nígbà tí ó yá, ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í sunkún gidi."
1378,Would she have that strength to attack Labake?,Ṣé á lè ní okun láti kojú Làbákẹ́?
1379,Would her feeble hands not disappoint her that day?,Ṣé ọwọ́ rẹ̀ tí ò lágbara yìí ò ní dójú tì í lọ́jọ́ náà?
1380,"Would Labake's youthful energy not rumble her tired stomach, send steam rushing down her nostril, throw her tongue out of her mouth?","Ṣé agbára ọ̀dọ́ tó wà lára Làbákẹ́ òní da inú rẹ̀ tí ó ti rẹ̀ yìí rú, Ṣé kò ní ran eruku jáde nímú rẹ̀, tí á sì yọ ahọ́n kúrò lẹ́nu rẹ̀?"

1386,Esuniyi had promised to follow her.,Èṣùníyì ti ṣe ìlérí láti tẹ̀lé e.
1387,They were going together to bring him from town.,Wọ́n jọ máa lọ sí ìgboro láti mú un wá ni.
1388,"For the better part of the night, Mama's eyes refused to close.","Ní gbogbo òru, Màmá kò le sùn."
1389,"Alamu would, no doubt, be embarrassed to see her in company of a fetish priest in the dreaded apete garment.","Láìsí àní-àní, ojú á ti Àlàmú láti rí i pẹ̀lú babaláwo tí ó wọ ẹ̀wù apẹtẹ tí ó kuńfún ẹ̀rù."
1390,"But that was how it should be, he should understand.","Ṣùgbọ́n bí ó ṣe yẹ kí ó rí nìyẹn, ó yẹ kí ó yée."
1391,He should try to understand ... he must understand.,A gbìyànjú láti ní òye... O gbọ́dọ̀ yé e.
1392,Mama's eyes started blinking ... blinking.,Màmá bẹ̀rẹ̀ sí i ṣẹ́ ojú... ṣẹ́ ojú.
1393,Finally the eyes closed up in sleep.,"Nígbẹ̀yìn gbẹ́yín, ó sùn."
1394,"The old woman's mind, thereafter, went numb to everything.",Ọkàn ìyá àgbàlagbà kúrò nínú gbogbo nǹkan nígbà tó yá.
1395,Numb to the hooting of the owl on the surrounding trees of the forest.,Ó kúrò nínú híhó ẹyẹ òwìwí lórí àwọn igi igbó àyíká.
1396,Numb to the incessant barking of the dogs in the centre of the village.,Ó kúrò nínú gbígbó àwọn ajá ń ààrin gùngun ìlú.
1397,"It was not anything easy, saying the final goodbye to a home that had been one's own for a long time.",Kì í ṣe ohun tí ó rọrùn láti ṣe “ó dààbọ̀” sí ilé tí ó tí jẹ́ ti ẹni fún  ìgbà pípẹ́ .
1398,No matter the way such a home had presented itself to the person leaving it.,"Láìwo bí ilé náà ti ṣe gbé ara rẹ̀ kalẹ̀, fún ẹni tí ó ń fi í lẹ."
1399,Labake knew this very well.,Làbákẹ́ mọ èyí dáadáa.
1400,"So now, she heaved a heavy sigh and looked round nervously at everything inside the house.","Ní báyìí, ó mí àmíkàn ó sì wo gbogbo nǹkan inú ilé yíká tìlọ́ra tìlọ́ra."
1401,She was probably spending her last day in Alamu's house.,"Bóyá, ọjọ́ rẹ̀ tí ó kẹ́yìn, ní ó ń lò yìí nílé Àlàmú."
1402,She had dressed up and was about to go out to do some urgent business in town.,Ó ti múra ó sì fẹ jáde láti lọ ṣe àwọn òwò kíá kíá kan ní ìgboro.
1403,"Already, she had negotiated with a mammy wagon driver.",Ó ti bá awakọ̀ ọ̀kọ̀ akẹ́rù kan dú nàá-dúrà sílẹ̀.
1404,"The driver would be around tomorrow with his vehicle, to carry away her things.",Awakọ̀ náà ń bọ̀ lọ́la pẹ̀lú ọ̀kọ̀ rẹ̀ láti wá fi kó àwọn nǹkan rẹ̀ lọ.
1405,She'd told the driver how she wanted the job done.,Ó ti sọ fún dẹ́rẹ́bà náà bí ó ṣe fẹ́ kí isẹ́ náà ṣe rí.
1406,"She wanted the job completed with dispatch, in not more than, say, two hours.","Ó fẹ́ kí isẹ́ náà parí láìfàkókò ṣòfò, kí ó má ju bí i, kání wákàtí méjì."
1407,The neighbours attention should not be attracted at all.,Kò gbọdọ̀ pe àkíyèsí àwọn aládúgbò rárá.
1408,The mammy-wagon driver had promised his Co-operation and assured Labake that the business would not take him and his men more than one hour.,"Awakọ̀ ọkọ̀-akẹ́rù náà ti ṣe ìlérí ìfọwọ́sọwọ́pọ̀ rẹ̀, ó sì fi Làbákẹ́ lọ́kàn balẹ̀ pé isẹ́ náà kò ní gba òun àti àwọn èèyàn òun ju wákàtí kan lọ."
1409,"I swear to God Almighty who made me, he said, sucking his forefinger and then pointing it to the sky emphatically.","Mo fi Ọlọrún tó dámi ṣẹlẹ́rìí, awakọ̀ náà sọ èyí, ó fa ìka ìlábẹ̀ rẹ̀ mú, ó sìnáàsí ojú ọ̀runfún àtẹnumọ́."
1410,Labake was happy.,Inú Làbákẹ́ dùn.
1411,Final adieu! This had never been anything easy for anyone.,Ìdágbére ìkẹyìn! Èyí kì í ṣe ohun tí ó rọrùn fún ẹnikẹ́ni.
1412,And it was not going to be an easy thing for Labake either.,Kò sì lè jẹ́ nǹkan tí ó rọrùn fún Làbákẹ́ náà.
1413,Her heart started beating fast.,Okàn rẹ bẹ̀rẹ̀ sí í lù kì kì kì.
1414,There were so many things to say goodbye to.,Àwọn nǹkan tí ó fẹ ki pé ó dì gbóṣe pọ̀.
1415,"She entered the kitchen, muttered something to herself, and came out of it. She entered the bathroom, whispered something to herself and went into the toilet.","Ówọ ilé ìdáná, ó sọ̀rọ̀ wúyẹ́wúyẹ́ ara rẹ̀, ó sì jadé. Ó wọ balùwẹ̀, ó sọ̀rọ̀ kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́ sí ara rẹ̀, ó sì wọ ilé-ìgbé."
1416,"In a minute, she came out of the small room, and peeped inside Alamu's room.","Ní ìṣẹ́jú kan, ó jáde kúrò nínú yàrá kékeré, ó sì yọjú wo ìyàrá Àlàmú."
1417,She surveyed the empty room briefly.,Ó wo yàrá ofìfo náà fírí...
1418,"She saw Alamu's dirty  clothes piled up on the standing hanger, some of them scattered on the bed.","Ó rí asọ ìdọ̀tí Àlàmú tí ó kó jọ sórí ibi ìfasọkọ́ onídùró, àti àwọn mìíràn tí ó fọ́nká sí orí ibùsùn."
1419,A pyramid of files stood on his table.,Atòjọ fáílì ìwé dúró lórí tábílì rẹ̀.
1420,Then those cob-webs in the corners of the room.,Lẹ́yìn náà ni àwọn jà-ǹ-kárìwọ̀ kọ̀rọ̀ yàrá.
1421,A foul odour permeated the air in Alamu's room.,Òórùn burúkú kan gba afẹ́fẹ́ inú yàrá Àlàmú. 
1422,Labake held her nostrils.,Làbákẹ́ fi ọwọ́ di ihò imú rẹ̀.
1423,Everything was topsy-turvy inside the strange room - the room of a mad man! Labake slammed Alamu's door and went inside her own room again.,"Gbogbo nǹkan ní ó doríkodò nínú yàrá àjòjì yìí – yàrá ọkùnrin wèrè kan! Làbákẹ́ jan ilẹ̀kùn náà padé, ó sì tún wọ inú yàrá tirẹ̀."
1424,"In another minute, she came out of it and emerged in the sitting room, her eyes desperately burning red.","Ní ìṣẹ́jú mìíràn, ó jáde níbẹ̀ ó sì wọ yàrá ìgbafẹ́, ojú rẹ̀ pọ́n gidi."
1425,That was the end! She rushed out of the flat into the street.,Òpin nì yẹn! Ó kù gìrì jáde kúrò ní ilé náà wọ òpópónà.
1426,"Instinctively, she gazed back at their flat.","Tiyè-tiyè, ó padà wo ilé wọn."
1427,What a dreadful picture Alamu's flat now cut in her eyes.,Irú àwòrán ìbẹ̀rù wo ní ilé Àlàmú wá dà lójú rẹ̀.
1428,"When they first moved into the flat shortly after their wedding, it was with the high hope of making the place a paradise.","Nígbà tí wọn kọ́kọ́kó wọ inú ilé náà ní kété tí wọn ṣègbeyàwó, ó wà pẹ̀lú ìrètí gíga láti sọ ilé náà di párádísè."
1429,She encouraged Alamu to purchase items that would make the house look exquisite.,Ó gba Àlàmú níyànjú pé kí ó ra àwọn nǹkan ti yóò mú kí ilé náà rẹwà.
1430,And she used all her experience as a trained model and designer to make the home look good.,Ó sì lo gbogbo ìrírí rẹ̀ gẹ́gẹ́ bí ológe àti olùdárà láti jẹ́ kí ilé náà rí dáadáa.
1431,"She rested flower vases on all the window panes, hung photographs neatly on the wall in the corners of the sitting room and the bedrooms.","Ó kó àwọn àpótí òdòdó sí ojú àwọn fèrèsé, ó fi àwòrán kọ́ sára ògiri ní kọ̀rọ̀ yàrá ìgbafẹ́ àti àwọn iyẹ̀wù."
1432,They purchased special carpets for the sitting room.,Wọ́n ra kápéétì ara ọ̀tọ̀ fún yàrá ìgbafẹ́.
1433,The curtains and window blinds were of air quality.,Àwọn kọ́tíìnì àti ìbòjú fèrèsé jẹ́ gidi.
1434,Everything inside the house in order.,Gbogbo nǹkan inú ilé ló wà létò-létò.
1435,Visitors to their house breathed the smell of fresh flowers and were full of for the lady of the house.,"Àwọn àlejò tó bá wá sí ilé wọn máa ń gbóòórùn òdòdó tútù, wọn sì máa ń kan sárá sí ìyá-ilé náà."
1436,Labake was grand style - so it seemed pleased.,Èyí tẹ́ Làbákẹ́ lọ́rùn.
1437,The matrimonial home had taken off in.,Ilé ọkọ náà ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ ní ara ọ̀tọ̀ bí ó ṣe jọ.
1438,But was that truly a home?,"Ṣùgbọ́n, ṣe ilé nìyẹn?"
1439,Labake was later compelled to begin asking herself.,Làbákẹ́ padà bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í tún ara rẹ̀ bi.
1440,"Was she not merely decorating a house, instead of building a home?","Ṣé kì í ṣe pé ó kàn dára sí ilé lásán ni, kàkà kí ó fi kọ́ ilé?"
1441,It did not take Labake a long time to realize that building a good matrimonial home was more than merely furnishing and decorating the rooms of a building.,Kò pẹ́ kí ó tó yé Làbàkẹ́ pé kíkó ilé ọkọ ẹni ju títò àti dídárà si àwọn yàrá ilé lọ.
1442,"The real home was made up of people - husband and wife interacting intimately with each other, loving each other, planning together, looking ahead to the future with hope and optimism.","Ilé gidi ni àwọn ènìyàn – ọkọ àti ìyàwó tí wọn ń bá ara wọn sọ̀rọ̀ tímọ́-tímọ́, tí wọn nífẹ̀ẹ́ ara wọn, tí wọn jọ ń ṣètò, tí wọ́n jọ ń wo ọjọ́ iwájú pẹ̀lú ìrètí àti ìgbàgbọ́ pé ohun gbogbo á dára."
1443,The real matrimonial home was made of human beings with human feelings.,Ilé ọkọ gidi kún fún ènìyàn àti ìmọ̀lára ènìyàn.
1444,Not the building - wall and roof.,Kì í ṣe ilé lásán – òrùlé àti ògiri.
1445,"Not the hypocritical decoration of the rooms, Labake now knew.","Kì í ṣe bí á ṣe dára sí àwọn yàrá, Làbákẹ́ ṣẹ̀ṣẹ̀ mọ̀."
1446,She clutched her small handbag firmly under her and walked out into the street hailing a taxi.,"Ó fi báàgì ìkọ́pá rẹ̀ sábẹ́ apá rẹ̀ ó sì rìn wọ òpòpónà náà, tí ó ń pé kabúkabú."
1447,"It did not take her long, this time, to get to Oke-Ado.","Kò pẹ ẹ́, lásìkò yìí, kí ó tó dé Òkè-Àdó."
1448,"Although the short-cut was still impassable, a of work had been done by the government on the long Agbeni Ogunpa road.","Bí ó tilẹ̀ jẹ́ pé, ọ̀nà àbùjá ò tí ko ṣe é gbà, ọ̀pọ̀lọpọ̀ iṣẹ́ ni ìjọba ń ṣe ní títì Agbeni sí Ògùnpa gígùn yẹn."
1449,Some discipline was injected into the danfo and taxi drivers and the war against indiscipline with the street had been waged and won too.,"Àwọn òfin ìkóni-níjàánu kan ti wọ ara àwọn awakọ̀ dánfó àti kabúkabú, àti ogun tí wọn dàkọ, àíní-ikora-ẹni-nìjàánu àwọn ọlọ́jà òpòpónà tí ó ti ṣe."
1450,They all feared the new decree soon to be enforçed by the government.,Gbogbo wọn ni wọ́n bẹ̀rù òfin tuntun tí àwọn ìjọba fẹ́ fi lẹ́lẹ̀ láìpẹ́.
1451,"Any, driver who parked his vehicle wrongly would be summarily dealt with by the mobile courts; any driver who caused a traffic hold-up' would also be handed over to the courts and for traders who engaged in street trading, stiff penalties awaited them.","Awakọ̀ kí awakọ̀ tó bá gbé ọkọ̀ rẹ̀ sọ́nà lọ́nà àìtọ́ á fojú winá ní àwọn ilé ẹjọ́ alágbèéká; awakọ̀ to bá dá “súnkẹrẹ-fàkẹrẹ” ọkọ̀ sílẹ̀, wọn á fà á lé ilé-ẹjọ́ lọ́wọ́; àwọn ọlọ́jà tí ó bá tajà ní òpópónà, ìjìyà tí ó le ń dúró dè wọ́n."
1452,"So now, the street was clear and driving on Agbeni Ogunpa road, like every other road of the city, was becoming more and more pleasurable.","Ní báyìí, òpòpónà wá mọ́ féfé, wíwakọ̀ lópòópónà Agbeni Ògùnpa wá ń dùn mọ́ bí i tí àwọn títì mìíràn nílùú ńlá."
1453,Soon Labake was in her lawyers' chambers.,"Láìpẹ́,  Làbákẹ́ ti dé ìyẹ̀wù àwọn agbejọ́rò."
1454,The environment in the chambers no longer scared her.,Àyíká ìyẹ̀wù náà kì í bà á lẹ́rù mọ́.
1455,It had become familiar to her now.,Ó tí mọ́ ọn lára.
1456,The panic and the anxiety which gripped her during her first visit had completely disappeared.,Ìpayà àti àìbalẹ̀ ọkàn tí ó gbá a mú nígbà àkọ́kọ́ tí ó máa dé ibẹ̀ ti pòórá pátápátá.
1457,She felt at ease now as she spoke freely with the friendly receptionist.,Ara rẹ̀ balẹ̀ báyìí bí ó ṣe ń bá olùgbàlejò iléeṣẹ́ náà sọ̀rọ̀.
1458,"""You are lucky today madam', the receptionist said, presenting a smile.","“Ẹ ṣoríire lónìí màdáámú”, olùgbàlejò náà sọ̀rọ̀ pẹ̀lú ẹ̀rín músẹ́ lẹ́nu,"
1459,"""Yes, lucky. He's in', ""Really?","“Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, ẹ mọ̀ ọ́n rìn. Wọ́n wà nínú ilé”. “Ṣé lóòótọ́?”"
1460,"Yes, Then I am lucky, ""You are indeed madam.","“Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni”, “Mo ṣoríire nìyẹn”, “Lóòótọ́ ni màdáámú."
1461,But you'll have to wait for a few minutes.,Ṣùgbọ́n ẹ ní láti dúró fún bí i ìṣẹ́jú díẹ̀.
1462,There's somebody in there with him him'.,Ẹnìkan wà pẹ̀lú wọn”.
1463,"Thank you, I'll wait'.","“Ẹ ṣeun, màá dúró”."
1464,This was Labake's fourth visit to the chambers.,Èyí ni ìgbà ẹ̀ẹ̀kẹ́rin tí Làbákẹ́ ti ṣe àbẹ̀wò sí ìyẹ̀wù náà.
1465,"She had not been lucky since her first visit, to meet any of the two lawyers.","Kò ní àǹfààní láti bá wọn, yàtọ̀ sí ìgbà àkọ́kọ́, kí ó bá ìkankan nínú àwọn agbẹjọ́rò méjèèjì."
1466,"At various times, she had been told they were out.",Ní ọ̀pọ̀ ìgbà wọ́n ti sọ fún un pé wọ́n jáde.
1467,At one time she was told Lawyer Mustafa had gone on a business trip overseas.,"Nígbà kan, wọ́n sọ fún un pé agbẹjọ́rò Mústàfá ti lọ fún ìrìnàjò òwò lókè-òkun."
1468,Labake was not surprised to hear that.,Kò ya Làbákẹ́ lẹ́nu láti gbọ́ ìyẹn.
1469,She remembered he had dropped a hint to that effect the other time.,Ó rántí pé ó ti sọ nǹkan tí ó jọ èyí ní ìgbàtí órí iyẹn.
1470,"He said he would make a trip to England or, was it to America?","Ó ní òun á rìn ìrìnàjò lọ sí Englandi, Àbí ṣé Amẹ́ríkà ni?"
1471,"During another visit, she was told that Lawyer Mustafa's partner had gone to argue a case in a Lagos Court.","Ní ìgbà àbẹ̀wò mìíràn, wọ́n sọ fún un pé ìkejì agbẹjọ́rò Mústàfá ti lọ ṣe àwíjàre ẹjọ́ kan ní ilé-ẹjọ́ Èkó."
1472,During Labake's last visit to chambers she met the lawyers' confidential secretary who assured her that action had started on her case.,"Nígbà àbẹwò ìgbẹ̀yìn Làbákẹ́ sí ibẹ̀, ó pàdé akọ̀wé àṣírí àwọn agbẹjọ́rò náà, tí ó fi í lọ́kàn balè pé iṣẹ́ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ lórí ẹjọ́ rẹ̀."
1473,"The case had been registered, and its strategy mapped out by the lawyers.","Wón ti ṣe àkọsílè ẹjọ́ rẹ̀, ọ̀nà àti ṣiṣẹ́ rẹ̀ sì ti jáde."
1474,"The wedding album, the marriage ring and the certificate she brought had been inspected and would be tendered in court as exhibits.","Ìwé àkójopọ̀ àwòrán ìgbéyàwó, òrùka ìgbéyàwó, àti ìwé-ẹ̀rí ìgbéyàwó tí ó mú wá ni wọ́n ti yẹ̀wò fínní fínní, wọn á sì fi hàn nílé ẹjọ́ gẹ́gẹ́ bí ẹ̀rí."
1475,Labake had listened in rapt attention.,Làbákẹ́ ti tẹ́tí pẹ̀lú ìfọkànsí.
1476,"What remained for her, the secretary said, was to formally meet any of the two lawyers for a brief chat.","Ohun tí ó kù fún un tí akọ̀wé náà sọ ni pé, kí ó pàdé ọ̀kan lára àwọn agbẹjọ́rò méjèèjì fún ìtàkùrọ̀sọ ráńpé."
1477,"Then they would quickly file the suit, issue a court summons to her husband, and prepare to go to court to argue the case.","Lẹ́yìn náà ni wọ́n á gbé ẹjọ́ náà lọ ilé-ẹjọ́, tí wọ́n á fi ìwé ìpèlẹ́jọ́ ráńṣ́ẹ́ sí ọkọ rẹ̀, wọn á sì gbaradì láti lọ sí ilé-ẹjọ́ láti ṣe àwíjàre ẹjọ́ náà."
1478,"The confidential secretary had assured her that her case was going to be very easy to prosecute, compared with the other naughty ones the lawyers handled.","Akọ̀wé àṣírí náà fi í lọ́kàn balẹ̀ pé ẹjọ́ rẹ̀ á rọrùn láti gbá mú, ó yàtọ̀ sí àwọn ẹjọ́ gbẹ̀ ẹ́ gbẹ̀ ẹ́, tí àwọn agbẹjọ́rò náà ti gbá mú."
1479,Hers would be quickly disposed of in not more than two proceedings.,Wọn átètè parí tirẹ̀ ní ìjókòó ẹ̀ẹ̀mejì.

1482,She would be meeting this second lawyer for the first time.,Á pàdé agbẹjọ́rò kejì yìí fún ìgbà àkọ́kọ́.
1483,"The friendly receptionist kept her at ease, talking intimately to her.","Olùgbàlejò tó kóni mọ́ra náà fi í lára balẹ̀, ó ń bá a sọ̀rọ̀ tímọ́tímọ́."

1486,"""And their father, madam?","“Àti bàbá wọn, màdáámú?”"
1487,"Fine, thank you', What else would Labake say?","“Wọ́n wà dáadáa, ẹ ṣeun”, Kí tún ni kí Làbákẹ́ sọ?"

1604,How could she have forgotten Adio so easily?,Báwo ni ó ṣe yára gbàgbé Àdìó kíá bẹ́ẹ̀?
1605,She was making a fool of herself.,Ó ń fi ara rẹ̀ ṣe yẹ̀yẹ́.
1606,"She watched him, speechless.",Ó ń wò ó láìsọ̀rọ̀.
1607,"When finally she heaved a  sign of relief, Adio asked:","Lèyín tí ó jàjà mí ìmí ìtura, Àdìó bèèrè pé:"

1626,"""How then has my friend ill-treated you Labake?",“Báwo ni ọ̀rẹ́ mi ṣé wá fìyà jẹ ọ́ Làbákẹ́?
1627,"Labake reflected for a minute, she tried to remember some instances of ill-treatment that she'd suffered in the hands of Alamu.","Làbákẹ́ ronú fún ìṣẹ́jú kan, ó gbìyànjú láti rántí àpẹẹrẹ àwọn ìgbà tí ó jìyà lọ́wọ́ Àlàmú."

1630,Adio smiled again.,Àdìó tún rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́.

1654,He may be absent-minded.,Ó lè má fọkàn sí o.
1655,But he is not mad.,Ṣùgbọ́n kò ya wèrè.
1656,Alamu is not mad.,Àlàmú ò ya wèrè.
1657,My friend is not mad.,Ọ̀rẹ́ mi ò ya wèrè.
1658,Labake had started perspiring.,Làbákẹ́ ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í làágùn.
1659,"She felt as if she was in dreamland, really she did not bargain for what she saw and heard. She was seized with the urge to jump up from her seat, walk out and snap","Ó ṣé e bí ìgbà tó bá wà ní ìlú àlá, kò retí nǹkan tí ó rí àti èyítí ó sì gbọ́.

1663,What Adio was saying had a shoking effect.,Nǹkan tí Àdìó ń sọ ń ṣiṣé àmúmọ́lẹ̀.
1664,They were things she did not want to hear but which she had no power to stop listening to - for no obvious reason.,"Wọ́n jẹ́ nǹkan tí kò fẹ́ gbọ́, Ṣùgbọ́n kò ní agbára láti yẹ gbígbọ́ rẹ̀ -  láìnídìí kankan."
1665,"But she had to speak up to some of the issues Adio was now raising, otherwise, Adio would heap all the blame on her and declare her guilty through and through.","Ṣùgbọ́n ó ní láti fèsì sí díẹ̀ lára àwọn ọ̀rọ̀ náà tí Àdìó ń sọ, bi bẹ́ẹ̀ kọ́, Àdìó á kó gbogbo ẹ̀bi lé e, á sì dá a lẹ́bi gbogbo rẹ̀."

1668,"""Mama?"" retorted Labake, ""Mama called me all sorts of names devil, enemies' agent, murderer holding me responsible for her son's plight, threatening to kill me if I did not pack out of her son's house immediately.","“Màmá?”, Làbákẹ́ dáhùn, “Kò sí orúkọ tí màmá ò pè mí tán – èṣù, aṣoju ọ̀tá, apààyàn –tí wọ́n ní èmi ni mò ń ṣé ọmọ àwọn, tí wọ́n lérí láti pa mí tí mi ò bá kó jáde ní ilé ọmọ àwọn lẹ́sẹ̀kesẹ̀."
1669,She swore oaths at me and cursed me.,"Wọ́n ṣépè, wọ́n sì gégùn-ún fún mi."
1670,I cannot relate now all I have suffered in the hands of his mother.,Mi ò lè sọ gbogbo nǹkan tójú mi rí lọ́wọ́ ìyá rẹ̀ tán báyìí.
1671,I can never forget.,Mi ò sì lè gbàgbé.
1672,"I don't think I will ever forgive either.""",Mi ò lérò pé mo lè dárí jìn ín láé pẹ̀lú”.
1673,"Labake unburdened her mind, out of anger at what she considered sheer injustice out of the anxiety to exonerate herself. Adio was happy.","Làbákẹ́ tú èrò ọkàn rẹ̀, pẹ̀lú ìbínú sín ǹ kan tí ó pè ní àìṣòtítọ́ nínú àníyàn àti fọ ara rẹ̀ mọ́. Inú Àdìó sì dùn."
1674,"That's good' he said, ""You have a point Labake.","“Ìyẹn dára”, ó sọ èyí, “O rí i sọ Làbákẹ́."
1675,"And you have made it beautifully, but remember, Labake, mama is old.","O sì sọ ọ dáa, Ṣùgbọ́n rántí, Làbákẹ́, màmá ti dàgbà."
1676,"She belongs to a different generation, old fashioned, traditional and superstitious.","Ọ̀wọ́ ìran mìíràn ni wọ́n ti wá – ará àtijọ́, aláṣà ni wọ́n, wọ́n sì tún máa ń gbàgbọ́ nínú nǹkan tí ò tó nǹkan."
1677,"Come to think of it, Labake, what Mama did is exactly what my own old mother would have done too in similar circumstance.","Tún rò ó,  Làbákẹ́, nǹkan tí màmá ṣe ni ìyá tèmi náà ì bá ṣe bó bá jẹ́ àwọn."
1678,You should know all these Labake.,Ó yẹ kí o mọ gbogbo èyí Làbákẹ́.
1679,"My friend couldn't have approved of Mama's stand, did he approve of it?","Ọ̀rẹ́ mi ò lè fọwọ́ sí ti màmá, àbíṣé ó fọwọ́ sí ọ̀rọ̀ màmá?"
1680,"I trust my friend. Labake reflected and slowly she said,","Mo jẹ́ rìí ọ̀rẹ́ mi. Làbákẹ́ rò ó, ó sì sọ ọ́ jẹ́jẹ́ pé,"
1681,"No. No... He did not, he's not aware of it.","“Rárá. Rárá... Kò ṣe bẹ́ẹ̀, Kò tiè gbọ́ sí i."
1682,"There was a time I wanted to let him know of it, but he would not listen.","Ìgbà kán wà ti mo fẹ́ sọ fún un, Ṣùgbọ́n kò ní í gbọ́."
1683,"So, I stopped talking about it to him.","Nítorí náà, mí ò sọ fún un mọ́."
1684,"In other words', Adio interjected, 'my friend did not know anything about Mama's behaviour?'","“Lọ́rọ̀ kan”, Àdìó dáhùn, “ọ̀rẹ́ mi ò mọ nǹkankan nípa ìhùwàsí màmá?”"
1685,"""No, so we cannot blame him... you cannot blame him for something he did not know about.","“Rárá”, fún ìdí èyí, a kò lè dá a lẹ́bi... O ò lè dáa lẹ́bi fún nǹkan tí kò mọ̀ nípa."
1686,Don't let us blame him Labake.,Má jẹ́ kí a dá a lẹ́bi Làbákẹ́.
1687,Adio had scored another point!,Àdìó tún ti ní àmì ayò mìíràn!
1688,Labake was annoyed with herself.,Làbákẹ́ ń bínú sí ara rẹ̀.
1689,"If she had not been caught unawares, she probably would have presented her case in a more coherent way.","Bí ò báṣé pé ó bá a lójijì ni, kò bá ti gbé ọ̀rọ̀ rẹ̀ kalẹ̀ lọ́nà tí ó dáa jù báyìí lọ."
1690,And now she didn't know whether to continue with the discussion or ask Audio to excuse her.,"Nísinsìnyí, kò mọ̀ bóyá kí ó tẹ̀síwájú pẹ̀lú ọ̀rọ̀ náà, tàbí kí ó tọrọ gáfárà lọ́wọ́ Àdìó. "
1691,"But before she ever had the time to reach a resolution, Adio had dealt the final knock-out blow...","Ṣùgbọ́n kí ó tó ráyè ṣé ìpinnu, Àdìó ti sọọ̀rọ̀ mìíràn lù ú..."

1693,"You have suffered, I know it.","O ti jìyà, mo mọ̀ ọ́n."
1694,"It is a pity, but suffering, you know, is part of the test of true love. Don't you agree?","Ó ṣeni láàánú, ṣùgbọ́n ìjìyà, tí o mọ̀ yìí, jẹ́ ara àdánwò ìfẹ́ òtítọ́. Ṣé o gbọ́?”"
1695,"Labake did not say 'yes', she did not say ""no"" either. She was confused.","Làbákẹ́ kò wí “bẹ́ẹ̀ ni”, kò sì wí “bẹ́ẹ̀ kọ́”. Ìrújú bá a."
1696,"The matter before her was a matter she had to spend days, even weeks, thinking about.","Ọ̀rọ̀ iwájú rẹ̀ yìí jẹ́ ọ̀rọ̀ tí ó ní láti lo ọjọ́, ọ̀sẹ̀ láti fi rò ó."
1697,No stand should be taken now.,Kò gbọdọ̀ sọ nǹkankan báyìí.
1698,Lawyer Adio had done his best.,Agbẹjọ́rò Àdìó ti sa ipá rẹ̀.
1699,He had played his part well.,Ó ti ṣiṣé rẹ̀ dáadáa.
1700,"Even as Labake stood up to go, she heard the lawyer promising he would pay them a visit at home, unfailingly, she should expect him.","Bí Làbákẹ́ ṣé dìde láti lọ, ó gbọ́ agbẹjọ́rò náà tí ó ń ṣèlérí láti bẹ̀ wọ́n wò nílé, kò ní í yẹ̀, kí ó máa retí rẹ̀."
1701,"Labake closed the door of the chambers gently behind her and was received outside with a sunny cheerful smile by her friend, the receptionist.

1702,"And downstairs, on the street, Adios drive was waiting, opening the door of his master's car to take Labake back home.","Ní ìsàlẹ̀, ní òpópónà, dẹ́rẹ́bà Àdìó ń dúró, ó sì ń ṣí ilẹ̀kùn ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ ọ̀gá rẹ̀ láti fi gbé Làbákẹ́ padà sílé."

1705,It was a Mercedes-Benz.,Ó jẹ́ ọkọ̀ mẹ̀sí ọlọ́yẹ́.
1706,"Life was no doubt smiling on Adio - a very successful lawyer, enjoying all the wonderful opportunities offered by the city.","Nǹkan ń dùn fún Àdìó, láìsí àní-àní– agbẹjọ́rò tó ní lárí ni, ó ń gbádùn gbogbo àǹfààní tí ìlú ní láti fún un."

1709,"Way back in England, Adio was a slim shy-looking man; so indigent - always praying for the quick arrival of his scholarship reimbursement from the High Commission.","Nìgbà tí wọ́n ṣì wà ní Englandi, Àdìó jẹ́ ọkùnrin pẹlẹbẹ kan, tí ojú máa ń tì; ó tálákà gan an – gbogbo ìgbà ni ó fi máa ń gbàdúrà pé kí ìdápadà ìwé-ọ̀fẹ́ rẹ̀ ótètè dé láti ọ̀dọ̀ àjọ tó ga jù."

1712,This was one place she did not always like visiting.,Èyí jẹ́ ibìkan tí kò nífẹ̀ẹ́ láti máa dé.
1713,"Apart from the noise everywhere, the motor park was the haven of all sorts of people.","Yàtọ̀ sí ti ariwo tó wà ni gbogbo ibẹ̀, ibùdókọ̀ jẹ́ àgọ́ ibi tí onírúurú ènìyàn wà."

1718,"The Council people had tried, without much success to do something about the security of life and property of the people who patronised the place.","Àwọn ará káńsù ti gbìyànjú, láì ṣàṣeyọrí nípa wíwá nǹkan ṣe sí ọ̀rọ̀ ààbò ẹ̀mí àti ohun ìní àwọn ènìyàn tó ń ná ibẹ̀."

1720,"She peered and craned her neck, meandering her way through passengers, hawkers and touts.","Ó yírùn yírùn, ó narùn narùn, ó ń wọ́nà láàrin àwọn èrò, àwọn òǹtàjà àti àwọn agbèrò."
1721,"At last she got to him, the mammy-wagon driver.","Ní gbẹ̀yìn gbẹ́yín, ó dé ọ̀dọ̀ àwọn awakọ̀ ọkọ̀ akẹ́rù náà."
1722,"There he was a little way off, by the side of his vehicle, engrossed in a noisy conversation with three of his mates.","Ibẹ̀ ni ó wạ̀, lọ́wọ́ ẹ̀yìn, lẹ́gbẹ̀ẹ́ ọkọ̀ rẹ̀, ó ń rojọ́ aláriwo pẹ̀lú mẹ́ta nínú àwọn akẹgbẹ́ rẹ̀."
1723,They  were probably discussing with her ... planning the strategy for the evacuation of her belongings.,"Bóyá iṣẹ́ bí wọ́n ṣé fẹ́ bá a kẹ́rù ni wọ́n ń ṣètò rẹ̀, òun ni wọ́n ń sọ."
1724,"If that was the case, then she was with them at the nick of time, she had come to tell him to drop the matter for some time.","Bí ó bá jẹ́ pé bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, ó mọ̀ ọ́n rìn nìyẹn, ó ti wá sọ fún wọn pé kí wọ́n ṣì fi ílẹ̀ fún ìgbà díẹ̀."
1725,There was a new development and the proposed evacuation would have to be shelved.,"Ìdàgbà sókè tuntun kan ló dé, wọn yóò sì ní láti sún ọjọ́ ẹrù kíkó síwájú."
1726,The mammy-wagon driver shrugged his shoulders when Labake told him about the postponement.,Awakọ̀ ọkọ̀-akẹ́rù náà mi èjìká rẹ̀ nígbà Làbákẹ́ sọ nípa ìsúnsíwájú náà fún un.
1727,"Till another time... Till another time, Labake said, 'May be next week or week after. But definitely till another time.","“Ó dìgbà mí ìn...ó dìgbà mí ìn”,  Làbákẹ́ sọ èyí, “Bóyá lọ́sẹ̀ tó ń bọ̀ tàbí èyí tó tẹ̀lé e. Ṣùgbọ́n ó dìgbà mí ìn."
1728,Sorry. I'll contact you again'.,Ẹ pẹ̀lẹ́. Mà á tún kàn sí i yín”.
1729,"Alright madam, no harm done', he answered in a not-too-happy tone.","Ó dáa màdáámú, kò sí wàhálà”, ó fèsì pẹ̀lú ohùn tí ò fì dùnnú hàn."
1730,That was the end of a small business that would have fetched quick money.,Ìyẹn ni òpin òwò kékéré tí ò bá mówó kíá wọlé fún un.
1731,He'd been unusually hilarious up to that time because he kept the idea of a quick early morning profit at the back of his mind.,"Inú rẹ̀ ti ṣàdéédé ń dùn títí di àsìkò yẹn, nítorí ó ti fi èrò èrè iṣẹ́ kíá òwúrò kùtùkùtù sọ́kàn."
1732,But now. Well.,Ṣùgbọ́n báyìí. Ó dáa.
1733,A commercial Peugeot 504 saloon car pulled up a few yards away from them and the owner of the car emerged flashing his teeth and waving to the mammy-wagon. The driver waved back throwing one or two nicknames at him.,"Ọkọ̀ pijó 504 kan kọjá lára wọn, ẹni tí ó ni í sì bóyín, ó sì ń juwọ́ sí awa kọ̀ọkọ̀-akẹ́rù náà. Awakọ̀ náà juwọ́ sí i padà, tí ó ń pè é ní ìnagijẹ rẹ̀ bí i mélòó kan."
1734,Baba o! A je pe aye sir!,“Bàbá o! Àjẹpẹ́ ayé sà”.
1735,Then turning back to Labake...,Lẹ́yìn náà ni ó kọjú sí Làbákẹ́ padà...
1736,"He is the chairman of the Drivers' Union... Our chairman... Very popular with us..', the driver said to Labake,","Àwọn ni alága àwọn ẹgbẹ́ awakọ̀... Alága wa... Máa ń bá wa ṣére gan an...”, awakọ̀ náà sọ fún Làbákẹ́."
1737,Labake looked closely at the man. Her eyes caught the plate number of his car.,Làbákẹ́ wo ọkùnrin náà. Ojú rẹ̀ ti gán-án-ní nọ́mbà ọkọ̀ náà.
1738,What! Labake stared at the car's registration number in frozen stillness.,Ẹ̀ẹ̀ẹ̀ẹ́n! Làbákẹ́ wo nọ́ḿbà náà pẹ̀lú ìgbọ̀nrìrì ojú kan.
1739,Her heart immediately started pumping hard... Alamu's car! Alamu's former car!,Ọkàn rẹ̀ bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í ṣiṣẹ́ lemọ́lemọ́... Ọkọ̀ Àlàmú! Ọkọ̀ Àlàmú tẹ́lẹ̀tẹ́lẹ̀!
1740,Still in very good condition!,Ni ó ṣì wà ní ipò tó dára yìí!
1741,Is that em.. the man's car?,“Ṣé ẹm...ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ ọkùnrin náà nìyẹn?
1742,"Labake asked, swallowing some saliva.","Làbákẹ́ béèrè, ó dạ́tọ́ mì."
1743,"Yes, his car, he got it second hand. Second hand?","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ rẹ̀ ni. Ó rà á ní àlòkù. Àlòkù?"
1744,"Yes, second hand, from one man they say was in trouble.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, àlòkù, lọ́wọ́ ọkùnrin kan tí wọ́n ló wà nínú ìṣòro."
1745,"Hem... Madam, there is plenty of trouble in this world you.","Ẹ̀m...màdáámú, wàhálà pọ̀ láyé yìí o."
1746,So Chairman bought the car cheap cheap from the man - the man in trouble... The mammy-wagon driver held out his two hands – to indicate the bigness of the trouble he was describing. Trouble?,"Nítorí náà ni alága wa ṣé rà á lọ́wọ́ rẹ̀ ní gbàǹjo – lọ́wọ́ ọkùnrin náà – ọkùnrin tó wà nínú ìṣòro yẹn..., awakọ̀ ọkọ̀ akẹ́rù náà yọwọ́ rẹ̀ síta láti fi ṣàpèjúwe bí ìṣòro tí ó ń sọṣé tóbi tó.

1747,"Yes madam, the alakowe man ran into trouble, money trouble.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni màdáámú, ọkùnrin alákọ̀wé náà kan ìjọ̀gbọ̀n, ìjọ̀gbọ̀n owó."
1748,"The man, they say, lost his job, and could no longer feed himself, feed his family.","Wọ́n ní ọkùnrin náà pàdánù iṣé rẹ̀, kò sì lè bọ́ ara rẹ̀, bọ́ ẹbí mọ́."
1749,"So he sold the car cheap cheap to Chairman.' You know the man then?"".","Nítorí náà lóṣé ta ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ náà ní gbàǹjo fún alága wa. ""Ẹ́ mọọkùnrin náà nìyẹn?"""
1750,Hum. Not quite. But one time I saw him walk past here. People say the man's head has turned now. I don't know,Hùn. Kò dájú. ṣùgbọ́n lásìkò kan mo rí i tí ó kọjá níbí. Àwọn ènìyàn sì sọ pé orí ọkùnrin náà ti yí báyìí. Mi ò mọ̀.
1751,"The hair on Labake's head stood up straight, hair cheeks wrinkled, giving the impression of somebody wanting to laugh if not for her brow which had knitted in several wrinkles at the same time! But, it was no laughter afterall.","Irun orí Làbákẹ́ dúró gírígírí, ẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ rẹ̀ hun pọ̀, óṣe é bí ìgbà  tí ó bá fẹ́ rẹ́rìn-ín, bí kì í báṣé irun òkè ojú rẹ̀tí ó hunpọ̀ ní àsìkò kan náà!

1752,"More than laughter. Better for her in the circumstance, to get away fast.","Ó ju ẹ̀rín lọ. Ó dáa fún un làsìkòyìí pé, kí ó tètèkúrò."
1753,"Otherwise, her supreme effort to keep back the tears would prove abortive and the tears already welling up now beneath her eyelids would come streaming down.","Bíbẹ́ẹ̀ kọ́, ìgbìyànjú rẹ̀ láti dá omi ojú náà padà yóò já sásán, omi ojú náà tí ó kún sí ìpéǹpéjú rẹ yìí á tó ṣàn wálẹ̀."

1756,"Yes, They say his wife was the one who turned his head with juju.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, wọ́n ní ìyàwó rẹ̀ ni ó fi òògùn yí i lóri."
1757,You women are dangerous. You all look fine and beautiful. But to move near you is fire o... 'Fire?,"Ẹ̀yin obìnrin léwu gan an. Gbogbo yín lẹ dùn ún rí tẹ́ ẹ rẹwà. ṣùgbọ́n àti súnmọ́ ọn yín, iná ni o... 'Iná?'"
1758,"Yes, real fire, madam. How can a wife be so wicked as to turn the husband's head with juju just for fun?""","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, iná gìdí màdáámú. Báwo ni ìyàwó kan ṣe lè níkà débi kí ó fi òògùn yí orí ọkọ rẹ̀ láì nídìí?”"
1759,"You believe it? Madam, I believe it o.","Ẹ gbà á gbọ́? Mo gbà á gbọ́ o, màdáámú."
1760,"I am sorry madam, but I don't trust women.","Ẹ má bínú o màdáámú, ṣùgbọ́n mi ò lè fọkàn tán obìnrin."
1761,My three wives at home know it. But this man's wife must be a witch.,"Àwọn ìyàwó mi mẹ́tẹ̀ẹ̀ta nílé mọ́. ṣùgbọ́n, àjẹ́ ni ìyàwó ọkùnrin yìí máa jẹ́."
1762,"I hear that people around them have decided they would stone the woman to death, today or tomorrow. Where?","Mo gbọ́ pé àwọn ènìyàn tó wà ní àyíká wọn ti pinnu láti sọ̀ko pa obìnrin náà, lónìí àbí lọ́la. Níbo?"
1763,"I don't know madam, people just say it all about. You women, I fear you. Women are the cause of all men's trouble.","Mi ò mọ̀ màdáámú, àwọn ènìyàn kàn ń sọ ọ́ káàkiri ni. Ẹyin obìnrin, mo bẹ̀rù yín. Àwọn obìnrin ni wọ́n máa ń fa wàhálà fún gbogbo ọkùnrin."
1764,"To have you at home, man must prepare well well.","Láti gbé e yín sílé, ọkùnrin ní láti múra dáadáa."
1765,"I am sorry madam, I can see you are not happy with me - the way you are looking. I am sorry indeed, but I know you cannot do that type of thing to your own husband using juju.","Ẹ má bínú màdáámú, mo ri pé inú yín kò dùn sí mi bí ẹṣe ń wò.

1766,I know you are not that type of woman who... who... who...,Mo mọ̀ pé ẹ kì í ṣé irú obìnrin tí...tí...tí...
1767,"The tears had now blurred Labake's vision, five seconds more and she would betray herself. So, she walked quickly away. I will see you again. Another time. Another time. I'll see you.","“Omijé náà ti ṣé ìran Làbákẹ́ bàìbàì, láàrin ìṣẹ́ju àáyá márùn-ún, á dalẹ̀ ara rẹ̀. Nítorí náà, ó tètè rìn kúrò.

1768,"Labake walked away across the motor park, wiping her face, looking straight in front of her, refusing to be distracted by the call of the hawkers left and right, inviting her to come and have a look at their second-hand articles.","Làbákẹ́ rìn koja ibùdókọ̀ náà, ó ń nu ojú rẹ̀, ó ń wo ọwọ́ iwájú rẹ̀ tààrà, ó kọ̀ láti jẹ́ kí ìpolówó àti ìpè àwọn ọlọ́jà dà á láàmú lọ́tùn-ún lósì, pé kí ó wá wo ọjà gbàǹjo tí wọ́n ń tà."
1769,"They jumbled all the articles together in great piles, fridges with their handlebars and locks damaged; television sets with their tuning knobs missing, tape recorders without either the bass tone control or the fast-rewind knobs, record players whose pick-up, armrests and safety catches had gone and standing fans with broken revolving boxes and speed switches. All these the hawkers now invited Labake's attention to, as she sought her way out of the jumble of the motor park.","Wọ́n kó àwọn ọjà náà pọ̀, ẹ̀rọ amómitutù tí ìfà lọ́wọ́ wọn ti bàjẹ́, ẹ̀rọ amóhùn-máwòrán tí ara rẹ̀ kò pé; ẹ̀rọ ìgbohùn sí lẹ̀tí àwọn nǹkankan ti yọ nínú rẹ̀; ẹ̀rọ akọrin tí àwọn ẹ̀yà ara rẹ̀ kò pé mọ́; àti àwọn fáànù adá dúró tí àwọn nǹkankan ti kúrò lára rẹ̀.

1772,Thank you for the other day madam,Ẹ ṣéun ọjọ́ màdáámú.

1774,"Madam, na me o... Na me de greet you so, madam.","Màdáámú, èmi ni o...èmi ni mò ń kíi yín, màdáámú."
1775,Labake cast one hateful look after another at the owners of the voice.,Làbákẹ́ fi ojú ìrira wo àwọn tó ni ohùn  náà.
1776,"She saw two men close on her heels, flashing their teeth at her - still greeting her, still coming after her, still wanting her to stop and talk.","Ó rí ọkùnrin méjì tí wọ́n ń tẹ̀lé e, tí wọ́n ń bóyín sí i – wọ́n sì ń kíi, wọ́n ń tẹ̀lé e, wọ́n fẹ́ kí ó dúró bá wọn sọ̀rọ̀."
1777,"She ignored them and walked faster... there was no length hawkers would not go to attract your attention - petting you, smiling at you, joking with you, calling you sister, auntie', madam all to cajole you into purchasing one item or another...","Ó pa wọ́n tì, ó sì rìn kíá... kò sí nǹkan tí ọlọ́jà ò lèṣe láti fi pe àkíyèsí rẹ – wọn á fọwọ́ tọ́ ọ, wọn á rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́ sí ọ, wọn á bá ọ dápàárá, wọn á pè ọ́ ní ""sìstá"", àǹtí, màdáámú – gbogbo rẹ̀ láti rí ipé o ra nǹkankan tàbí òmíràn..."
1778,"Another quick look at the two men and Labake was sure she was not seeing them for the first time. Still, she kept on walking fast.","Ó sáré wo àwọn ọkùnrin méjì náà lẹ́ẹ̀ kansí i, ó sì dá Làbákẹ́ lójú pé kì íṣé ìgbà àkọ́kọ́ tí yóò rí wọ́n rè é.

Labake's footsteps quickened.","Àwọn alátùn-únṣé” tó gbé ẹ̀rọ amómitutù, ẹ̀rọ amóhùn-máwòrán àti fáànù olókè wọn lọ ní oṣù díẹ̀ sẹ́yìn – fún “àtúnṣe”!

1782,"She was almost running now, A minute's delay, something told her, and she would see what would make her faint on the spot, from the jumbled mass of those second hand articles inside these men's stalls.","Ó fẹ́rẹ̀ ẹ́ lè máa sáré báyìí, bí ó bá dúró ìṣẹ́jú kan pẹ́, nǹkankan ń sọfún un pé á rí nǹkan tó lè mú un dákú níbẹ̀, láti inú ọjà àlòkù inú ìsọ̀ àwọn Ọkùnrin yìí."

1785,"At home, Labake shouted, Come out! Come out Alamu!","Nílé, Làbákẹ́ pariwo, Jáde! Jáde! Àlàmú! "
1786,Come out of your room! Out of your hiding! I must talk to you now. Nothing will stop me!,Jáde nínú yàrá rẹ! Jáde níbi tó o sá pamọ́ sí! Mo gbọ́dọ̀ bá ọsọ̀rọ̀ báyìí. Nǹkankan ò ní dámi dúró!

1795,"Soon the sharp cry of a soul in torment came from inside the room - lasting for some three minutes, stopping for some two minutes only to pick up again like the slow, on-and-off pain of guinea worm, Ceasing and picking up, picking up and ceasing.","Nígbà tó yá, igbe ẹkún ọkàn tíì yà ń jẹ wá láti inú yàrá – ó pẹ́ fún ìṣẹ́jú mẹ́ta kan, ó dáwọ́ dúró fún bí ìṣẹ́jú méjì kan, ó tún bẹ̀rẹ̀ bí ìrora sò bìà, bí óṣe máa ń dun ni, tí á tún rowọ́.

1802,Hundreds of naira – even thousands - had gone down the drain!,Ọgọọgọ́rùn-ún náírà - títí mọ́ ẹgbẹẹgbẹ̀rún - ló ti ṣòfò.
1803,"Silence now lay upon the whole city, the air was old and still.","Ìdạ́kẹ́ rọ́rọ́ wá wà ní gbogbo ìlú, afẹ́fẹ́ náà tutù, ó sì dákẹ́ rọ́rọ́."
1804,What broke the stillness now was the intermittent sound of the whistle of the night watchmen and the konleogbele sound of their bells.,Nǹkan tí ó da ìdákẹ́ rọ́rọ́ náà láàmú ni ariwo lemọ́ lemọ́ fèrè àwọn ọlọ́dẹ àti ohùn kó-ń-lé-ó-gbé-lé agogo wọn.
1805,"The wall clock continued ticking away, it was now two o'clock in the morning. The sound of the alarm watch blare's ears, she came to the sitting room and sat down.","Aago ń lọ, ó ti wá di aago méjì géérégé lówùúrọ̀. Ohùn aago ìdágìrì dé etí Làbákẹ́, ó wá sí yàrá ìgbàlejò ó sì jókòó."
1806,Her eyes gazed intently at the door resolving she would take Alamu up on several issues the very minute he showed his face in the house.,Ó tẹjú mọ́ ilẹ̀kùn pẹ̀lú ìpinnu pé òun á bá Àlàmú fa oríṣìíríṣìí ní ìṣẹ́jú tí ó bá fojú hàn nínú ilé.
1807,"Alamu had to satisfy her with a concrete explanation on all those things she had heard from people from neighbours, from his friend and from the mammy-wagon driver.","Àlàmú ní láti tẹ́ ẹ lọ́rùn pẹ̀lú àlàyé tó dán mọ́rán lórí gbogbo nǹkan tí ó gbọ́ lẹ́nu àwọn èèyàn – àwọn aládùúgbò, lẹ́nu ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ àti awakọ̀ọkọ̀-akẹ́rù náà."
1808,"His life had become one bundle of mystery to her and it was, Alamu alone who could interprete the mystery.","Ayé Àlàmú wá jẹ́ àdììtú sí i, Àlàmú nìkan ló sì lè tú u."
1809,His life had become one big knot and it was he alone who could untie it. That he had to do the very moment he stepped into the house.,Ayé rẹ̀ ti di kókó ńlá kan tí wọ́n so pa tí ó sì jẹ́ pé òhun nìkan ni ó lè tú u. Ìyẹn ni ó ní láti ṣe ní kété bó báṣé ń wọlé.
1810,Labake had seen a lot of things herself – factual and reasonably authentic.,Làbákẹ́ ti rí oríṣìíríṣìí nǹkan fún rarẹ̀ – tí ó jẹ́ kókó tí ó sì jẹ́ ògidì.
1811,"What explanation would Alamu give to them all? The explanation must be so convincing, so persuading to satisfy her.","Àlàyé wo ni Àlàmú yóò ṣé sí gbogbo rẹ̀? Àlàyé náà gbọ́dọ̀ lè yíni lọ́kàn padà, kí ó lè tẹ́ ẹ lọ́rùn."
1812,She wondered what further role Alamu's friend was going to play in the matter.,Ó wòye irú ipa tí ọ̀rẹ́ Àlàmú á tún fẹ́ kó nínú ọ̀rọ̀ náà.
1813,How effectively were they going to handle the matter of the mother-in- law?,Báwo ni wọ́n ṣe fẹ́ gba ọ̀rọ̀ ìyá ọkọ rẹ̀ mú?
1814,"For an immediate query, where had Alamu gone to?","Fún ìdáhùn kíákíá, níbo ni Àlàmú  lọ?"
1815,Why did he spend the night there?,Kí ló sì fà á tí ó fi sun ibẹ̀ mọ́jú?
1816,Why did he refuse to let her know before hand that he would keep the night outside?,Kíni ìdí tí kò fi sọ fún un tẹ́lẹ̀ pé òun á sùnta?
1817,It was the early-morning drum signal on a neighbour's radio set which answered her questions.,Ohùn ìlù òwúrọ̀ kùtùkùtù orí rédíò aládùúgbò kan ló dáhùn ìbéèrè rẹ̀.
1818,A not too-satisfying answer merely indicating the arrival of dawn.,Ìdáhùn tí kò tẹ́ni lọ́rùn tó ń sọ pé ilẹ̀ ti mọ́.
1819,"Labake's head ached badly, she felt pain all over the body and yawned.","Orí fọ́ Làbákẹ́ gidi, ara ń ro ó, ó sì yán."
1820,Was this what they called suffering for the sake of love?,Ṣé nǹkan tí wọ́n ń pè ní ìjìyà ìfẹ́ rè é?
1821,Love must be a giddy thing indeed to make one suffer so much like this.,Ìfẹ́ wá jẹ́ nǹkan gidi kan tó ń mú èèyàn jìyà báyìí.
1822,The city at dawn! Everything was alive again.,Ìlú ńlá ní dàájí! Gbogbo nǹkan ti tún jí sáyé.
1823,The sleeping giant has woken up! The hustle and bustle of city life had started as usual.,Òmìrán tó ń sùn ti jí! Ìgbòkègbọdọ̀ ìlú ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ bí ó ṣé máa ń wáyé.
1824,"The city people, like frightened ants, hurried away to their various places of work.","Àwọn ará ìlú tètè ń gbọ̀nà ibi iṣẹ́ wọn lọ, bí ikòkòrò tẹ́rù ń bà."
1825,"It was work, work and work for them all. Work and quench!",Iṣẹ́ iṣẹ́ iṣẹ́ ṣáà ni fún gbogbo wọn. Iṣẹ́ àti ìyá.
1826,The bus stops were crowded.,Àwọn ìbùsọ-ọkọ̀ ni ẹ̀rọ̀ kún bámú.
1827,"Getting inside the city buses  was a battle - survival of the fittest forty nine sitting, ninety nine standing!","Rírí ọkọ̀ ìlú wọ̀ wá dogun – ẹni yára lòògùn ń gbè – “èèyàn mọ́kàndínláàádọ́ta ní jokòó, èèyàn mọ́kàndínlọ́gọ́rùn-ún nídùúró!”."
1828,The pregnant women fought it out with the same zeal and energy as the teenage girls rushing to school struggling to beat lateness.,"Àwọn aboyún ń jìjà gbara pẹ̀lú okun, bẹ́ẹ̀ náà làwọn ọmọbìnrin tó ń kánjú àtidé ilé-ìwé ki wọ́n má pẹ̀ ẹ́."
1829,And the able-bodied young men demonstrated their agility by crashing inside the city buses through the small windows of the vehicle!,Ati àwọn ọ̀dọ́mọkùnrin tó dá ṣáṣá tí wọ́n ń fi agbára wọn hàn nípa bíbẹ́ wọnú ọkọ̀ láti ojú fèrèsé kéé-kèè-kééọkọ̀!
1830,"In Labake's area of the town, the local hawkers had started advertising their commodities in sing- song, sonorous voices.","Ní apá àdúgbò Làbákẹ́ nílùú náà, àwọn oníkiri ń polówó ọjà wọn ní ohùn orin, ohùn dídùn."
1831,A group of young boys and girls had gathered round the small stall in front to purchase the rice and tuwo which had started boiling hot inside the pots on the fire - a look of expectancy on their faces.,Ọ̀wọ́ àwọn ọmọkùnrin àti ọmọbìnrin kéé-kèè-kéé kan ti yí ìsọ̀ kan ká níwájú láti ra ìrẹsì àti túwó tí ó ti ń hó nínú ìkọ̀kọ̀orí iná – wọ́n ń retí kó jinná kíá.
1832,Labake stretched her legs and came out to the verandah of their house.,"Làbákẹ́ na ẹsẹ̀ rẹ̀, ó sì jókòó sí ìta ilé wọn."
1833,The local seamstresses were already on their way to their various shops.,Àwọn aránṣọbìnrin ìbílẹ̀ náà ti wà lọ́nà ìsọ̀ wọn.
1834,"They balanced their sewing machines on the head with accustomed ease, chattered all along about this and that topic, connected with their trade...","Wọ́n gbé maṣíìnì ìránṣọ wọn sórí pẹ̀lú ìrọ̀rùn lọ́nà tó ti mọ́ wọn lára, tí wọ́n sì ń tàkùrọ̀sọ lórí oríṣìíríṣìí nǹkan tí ó jẹmọ́ òwò wọn..."
1835,"Labake too used to be a good seamstress and very creative too. She could design garments, even now, to match the latest trends in fashion.","Làbákẹ́ náà jẹ́ ránṣo-ránṣo gidi tí ó sì mọṣẹ́ dáadáa. Ó lè dárà sí ẹ̀wù, pàápàá báyìí láti bá ìgbà mu."
1836,"While in England, she took some courses in sewing and designing.","Nìgbà tó ṣì wà ní Englandi, ó kọ́ ẹ̀kọ́ nínú ìránṣọ àti ìdáràsí."
1837,"This in addition to her core course which was modelling, it had not been possible for her to practise her trade here in the country, straight away, because of people's general apathy to it.","Èyí kún ẹ̀kọ́ rẹ gan an tí ó jẹmọ́ oge, kò ṣeésé fún un láti ṣé òwò rẹ̀ ní orílẹ̀-èdè yìí lẹ́sẹ̀kẹsẹ̀ nítorí ẹ̀rọ̀ gbogbo ògbò àwọn ènìyàn nípa rẹ̀."
1838,"Otherwise, like these seamstresses, she too would by now have been on her way to her place of work.","Bí bẹ́ẹ̀ kọ́, bí i àwọn aránṣọbìnrin yìí, òun  náà ìbá wà lọ́nà ibiṣẹ́ tirẹ̀ báyìí."
1839,"For now, she was a full time housewife.","Ṣùgbọ́n ní àkókò yìí, ìyàwó ilé tí kò níṣẹ́ àṣejẹ ni."
1840,"Labake took her eyes away from the seamstresses, who had negotiated the comer of the street.","Làbákẹ́ gbójú rẹ̀ kúrò lọ́dọ̀ àwọn aránṣọbìnrin náà, tí wọ́n ti ń bọ́ sí kọ̀rọ̀ òpópónà náà."
1841,"She yawned, she was, understandable, not feeling comfortable, her limbs were stiff, her eyes were drowsy. She felt like that housewife who went through the ordeal of pounding five yam-filled mortars the previous day, all alone, for some late-night visitors.","Ó yán, ara kò rọ̀ ọ́rárá, apá rẹ̀ yi, òòyì ń kọ́ ojú rẹ̀.

1842,Her ribs and joints ache like that of a boxer who had just survived twenty gruelling rounds in a fight of the century! She stumbled inside again.,Ihà rẹ̀ àti oríkèéríkèé ara ń ro ó bí i ti ajẹ̀ṣẹ́ tí óṣẹ̀ṣẹ̀ yege ìjà lọ́nà ogún nínú ìdíje ìjà sẹ́ńtúri! Ó tún bẹ́ wọlé.
1843,"Zenabu was already in the Sitting room, standing at attention by the side of a small mound, something wrapped up inside a blue pillow case, placed in a plastic bucket.","Sènábù ti wà ní yàrá ìgbafẹ́, ó dúró ṣinṣin sí ẹ̀gbẹ́ òkìtì kékeré kan, nǹkan tí wọ́n dì sínú aṣọ ìrọ̀rí búlúù tí wọ́n gbé sínú garawa oníke."
1844,I am ready to go now ma.,Mo ti fẹ́ máa lọ nísinsìnyí mà.
1845,Labake took a cursory look at the small figure in front of her.,Làbákẹ́ wo kiní kékeré iwájú rẹ̀ láwòfín.
1846,"Yes, it was Zenabu, wanting to go, and taking permission from her.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, Sènábù ni, ó fẹ́ máa lọ, ó sì ń tọrọ ààyè lọ́wọ́ rẹ̀."
1847,"Go where, Zenabu? Go home ma.",Ibo lò ń lọ Sènábù? Mò ń lọ ilé mà.
1848,Home? Where? In Kwara.,Ilé? Níbo? Ní Kwárà.
1849,"Kwara? Yes. Kwara, My home ma.","Kwárà? Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, Kwárà, ilé mi mà."
1850,Why? What's wrong with you Zenabu?,Kílódé? Kí ló ṣé ọ́ Sènábù?”
1851,Nothing madam,Kò sí nǹkankan Màdáámú
1852,Come on Zenabu! What is it?,Sọ̀rọ̀ Sènábù! Kí ló ṣẹlẹ̀ ?
1853,Em... em... Nothing... Nothing madam.,Ẹm... ẹm... Kò sí... Kò sí màdáámú.
1854,Are you crazy! Are you mad!,Ò ń ṣièrè ni! Ṣó o ya wèrè ni!
1855,"Zenabu's cheeks wrinkled, her brows tensed and she closed her eyes.","Ẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ Sènábù hunjọ, irun ojú rẹ̀ yi, ó sì dijú rẹ̀."
1856,She soon opened them again and the tears came in beads chasing one another down her little cheeks.,"Ó tún ṣí ojú rẹ̀, omijé sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í dà wá lẹ̀ bí i ìlẹ̀kẹ̀ ní tẹ̀lé-ǹ-tẹ̀lé sẹ́ rẹ̀kẹ́ rẹ̀ kékeré."
1857,"Madam. Madam, she sobbed out, ""That's what. what they say you are.""","Màdáámú...màdáámú, óké jáde, “Nǹkan tí wọ́n ló ń ṣe yín nìyẹn”."

1859,Me? Who told you that?,Èmi? Ta ló sọ bẹ́ẹ̀ fún ọ?
1860,People in the other house.,Àwọn ará ilé kejì.
1861,Zenabu pointed her finger towards the houses around them.,Sènábù na ìka ọwọ́ rẹ̀ sí àwọn ilé tó wà lá yìí ká wọn.
1862,"They say my madam has gone mad, they say my master has gone mad too, they say my madam has gone crazy, they say I am living inside a mad house. The people there said it... Zenabu pointed her finger again.","Wọ́n ní màdáámú mi ti ya wèrè, wọ́n ní ọ̀gá mi ti ya wèrè, wọ́n ní inú iléwèrè ni mò ń gbé. Àwọn èèyàn ibẹ̀yẹn ló sọ ọ́...

1863,Neighbours! These illiterate neighbours!,Àwọn ará àdúgbò! Àwọn aládùúgbò puruntu yìí!
1864,"Labake lamented, they know nothing but to scandalise, to gossip, to slander, they had said things like these to her own hearing too before.","Làbákẹ́ pohùn réré, wọn ò mọ nǹkankan yàtọ̀ sí kí wọ́n kan èèyàn lábùkù, kí wọ́n ṣèké, kí wọ́n sìsọ̀rọ̀ banilórúkọjẹ́, wọn ti sọ irún ǹ kan bẹ́ẹ̀ sí etí rẹ̀ náà rí."
1865,"These packs of ignorant, illiterate neighbours.",Àwọn ọ̀wọ́ aládùúgbò aláì mọ̀kan-mọ̀kàn yìí.
1866,Their stock in trade is to assassinate character.,Àwọn tí wọ́n mọ̀ ọ́n ṣe ò ju kí wọ́n ba ti ènìyàn jẹ́.
1867,"They would not anchor their mouths. If she would still remain with Alamu, she would insist that they leave this illiterate infested area of the city.","Ẹnu wọn kìí gbé jẹ́ẹ́. Bí ó bá sì máa wà pẹ̀lú Àlàmú, á tẹnumọ́ ọn pé kí wọ́n kúrò ní àdúgbò àìmọ̀kan-mọ̀kàn yìí."
1868,She would insist that they pack off to a more exclusive section of the city - the G.R.A section - where civilised and well-informed people live in joyful isolation.,"A tẹnumọ́ ọn pé kí wọ́n lọ sí àdúgbò tó lajú níìlùú - agbègbè ìyàsọ́tọ̀ ìjọba - níbi tí àwọn ènìyàn tó lajú, tó mọ nǹkan tó ń lọ ń gbé tayọ̀ tayọ̀."
1869,Now these awfully detestable neighbours of theirs had started working on their innocent housemaid.,"Nísinsìnyí, àwọn aládùúgbò burúkú wọnyì ti ń ṣiṣé lórí ọmọ-ọ̀dọ̀ wọn tí ò mọ̀ kan."
1870,"If they had told Zenabu that it was Alamu alone who had gone mad, that would have been better.","Kání pé wọ́n sọ fún Sènábù pé Àlàmú nìkan ló ya wèrè, ìbá dáa."
1871,"Or if they had told the poor girl that old Mama, in addition had gone crazy, it would have been alright too.","Tàbí kání pé wọ́n sọ fún ọmọ náà pé Màmá náà ya wèrè, ìbá tún dáa."
1872,"But to say that she, Labake, had also gone mad? What arrant nonsense!","Ṣùgbọ́n kí wọ́n sọ pé òun, Làbákẹ́ náà ti ya wèrè? Irú ọ̀rọ̀kọ́rọ̀ wo nìyẹn?"
1873,"Zenabu... Zenabu... tell me, they told you Alamu had gone mad?","Sènábù... Sènábù... sọ fún mi, ṣé wọ́n sọ fún ọ pé Àlàmú ya wèrè?"
1874,"Yes, madam. But did they really tell you I had gone mad also?",Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni màdáámú. ṣùgbọ́n ṣé wọ́n diìdí sọ fún ẹ pé èmi náà ti ya wèrè ni?
1875,"Yes, they told me you are more mad.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, wọ́n sọ fún mi pé wèrè ti yín le jù."
1876,"Me? Yes, madam","Èmi? Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, màdáámú."
1877,"Now, Zenabu, is that why you are crying?","Ní báyìí, Sènábù, ṣé ìyẹn ló fà á tó o fi ń sunkún?"
1878,Is that why you want to return home to Kwara?,Ṣé ìdí tí o fi fẹ́ padà sílé ní Kwárà nì yẹn?
1879,"No, madam. What then?","Rárá, màdáámú. Kí wá ni?"
1880,They said you will tear my flesh... with your teeth... in the night.,Wọ́n ní ẹ máa fi eyín ya ẹran ara mi... ní alẹ́.
1881,"After I am asleep, they said you will not sleep on the day you will do it.","Lẹ́yìn tí mo bá sùn, wọ́n ní ẹ ò ní í sùn lọ́jọ́ tí ẹ bá máaṣé e."
1882,But that you will wait until I had slept off well.,Ṣùgbọ́n wọ́n ní ẹmá a dúró di ìgbà tí mo bá ti sùn wọra.
1883,Then you will grab me. Because you have gone mad.,"Lẹ́yìn náà lẹ ẹ́ wá gbá mi mú. Nítorí pé, ẹ ti ya wèrè."
1884,"They tell me all these things madam. And you believe them, Zenabu?","Wọ́n sọ gbogbo èyí fún  mi màdáámú. Ìwọ náà sì gbà wọ́n gbọ́, Sènábù?"

1886,"Yes, I stayed awake Zenabu, but you can't understand. Labake suddenly realised her own position.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, mi ò sùn Sènábù, ṣùgbọ́n kò lè yé ẹ. Làbákẹ́ déédé ráńtí ipò rẹ̀."
1887,"If Zenabu was on the offensive, then, she had to be on the defensive.","Bí Sènábù bá kà ásẹ́ṣẹ̀, òun ní láti gba arà rẹ̀ sílè."
1888,Zenabu... Zenabu. You can't understand why I stayed awake all through the night till this morning. You are too young to know why,Sènábù... Sènábù. Ìdí tí mo ṣé lajú sílẹ̀ láti àná títí di àárọ̀ yìí ò lè yé ẹ. O kéré láti mọ ìdí rẹ̀.

1890,Will you stop listening! Listening to these mad people! Will you stop talking about these crazy people!,Ṣé wà á dẹ́kun àti máa tẹ́tí sí àwọn wèrè yìí! Ṣé wà á dẹ́kun láti máa sọ̀rọ̀ nípa àwọn wèrè èèyàn yìí!”
1891,"Zenabu looked away and defiantly shrugged her little shoulders. It appeared she was with the neighbours, rather than with her.","Sènábù gbójú kúrò, ó sì gún èjìká rẹ̀. Ó jọ wípé kò gba ti Làbákẹ́, tàwọn aládùúgbò wọn ló gbà."
1892,"So, what are you going to do now Zenabu?","Níbá yìí, kí lo wá fẹ́ṣe Sènábù?"
1893,"Madam, I have packed my load.","Màdáámú, mo ti kó ẹrù mi."
1894,And? And I am going back home.,Ẹ̀n ẹ́n? Mo dẹ̀ ń padà lọ sí ilé.

1896,"No, madam. What then?","Rárá, màdáámú. Kí wá ni?"
1897,Just going back home...to my father and mother.,Mo kàn fẹ́ padà sílé ni...mo fẹ́ lọ bá  bàbá àti ìyá mi.
1898,"Ok. Zenabu, go back to your room now! Go and put down your load right now! You hear!","Ó dáa. Sènábù, padà sí yàrá rè nísinsìnyí! Lọ gbé ẹrù rẹ sílẹ̀ báyìí! Ṣé o gbọ́!"
1899,"Zenabu once more shrugged her shoulders and shook her little head daringly, rebelliously, the tears inside her eyes had completely dried up.","Sènábù tún gún èjìká ó dẹ̀ mirí tàfojúdi tàfojúdi, omijé ojú rẹ̀ ti gbẹ tán pátápátá."
1900,"A look of desperation was now visible on her innocent countenance, she did not move. Instead, she picked up her small load and clutched it firmly in her hands then stood rooted to the ground.","Ìwò ọ̀dájú ló wá hàn nínú ìrísí àìmọ̀kan rẹ̀,  kò mira.

1901,Labake was a bit scared. Was this little girl mad?,Èrù ba Làbákẹ́ díẹ̀. ṣé ọmọ kékeré yìí ya wèrè ni?
1902,She really must be mad. It would be better to allow this little wretch of a housemaid have her way.,Á jẹ́ pé ó ti ya wèrè. Á dáa kí ó jẹ́ kí ọmọ-ọ̀dọ̀ òsì yìí rọ́nà lọ.
1903,See her looking impudently. See her pouting her small lips. See fire inside her small eyes.,"Ẹ wò ó bí ó ṣé ń wò, tàfojúdi tàfojúdi. Ẹ wò bí óṣe ń ṣu ẹnu pọ̀. Ẹ wo iná lójú rẹ̀ kékeré."
1904,"Alright Zenabu', Labake said piping down, 'You can go to your home town... You are released.","Ó dáa Sènábù, Làbákẹ́ farabalẹ̀ sọ̀rọ̀, “O lè máa lọ sí ìlú yín... A ti tú ọ sílẹ̀."
1905,"Zenabu put down her small load and stretched out her hands. She wanted the balance of her monthly allowance and, of course, her transport fare, from madam.","Sènábù gbé ẹrù rẹ̀ kékeré sílẹ̀, ó sì nawọ́ rẹ̀. Ó fẹ́ gba owó-oṣù rẹ̀ tókù, àti owó ọkọ̀ rẹ̀ lọ́wọ́ màdáámú."
1906,"I have no money to give you... No transport fare to give you even since you are going away on your own volition. For money, I'm afraid you have to wait for master to retum.","Èmi ò ní owó kankan láti fún ọ... Mi ò ní owó ọkọ̀ láti fún ọ níwọ̀n ìgbà tó jẹ́ pé ò ń lọ ní tìẹ ni.

1907,Alright.. I will wait for master.,Ó dáa... Màá dúró de ọ̀gá.
1908,"Ok Zenabu, that's right, wait for him, go and stay in your room till master comes back?","Ó dáa Sènábù, ìyẹn dára, dúró dè é, lọ dúró nínú yàrá rẹ títí ọ̀gá á fi padà dé?"
1909,"No! No! I will stay here! I will stand here like this, till master will come. He will meet me here.","Rárá! Rárá! Màá dúró níbí! Màá dúró báyìí, títí ọ̀gá máa fi dé. Wọn á bá mi níbí."
1910,"Labake smiles to herself, this girl had thoroughly gone mad... Let her remain standing there, Labake yawned loud. She stood up and staggered towards her own room propping Tinu to her chest, she had become badly spent.","Làbákẹ́ rẹ́rìn-ín sí ara rẹ̀, ọmọ yìí ti ya wèrè gidi...

1911,Really intoxicated with sleep. Nature would not be cheated,"Ó ti rẹ̀ ẹ́ gidi, oorun sì ń kùn un gidi."
1912,It did not take Labake's eyes two minutes to  close up.,Kò gba ojú Làbákẹ́ ní ìṣẹ́jú mẹ́ta láti pàdé.
1913,It did not take her chest three minutes to begin heaving - like a reed in the tide.,Kò gba àyà rẹ̀ ní ìṣéju mẹ́ta láti bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í mí.
1914,Alamu did not travel to Lagos.,Àlàmú kò rìrìn àjò lọ sí Èkó.
1915,"As a matter of fact, he was very much around in town with Adio his friend, their meeting this time was a meeting with a difference.","Kódà, ó wà nìlúu pẹ̀lú Àdìó, ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀, ìpàdé wọn ló tè yìí jẹ́ ìpàdé tó ní ìyàtọ̀."
1916,"Adio looked at Alamu and smiled, Alamu too smiled back at Adio - a smile of satisfaction and contentment.","Àdìó wo Àlàmú , ó sì rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́, Àlàmú náà rẹ́rìn-ín padà sí Àdìó, ẹ́rín ìtẹ́lọ́rùn."
1917,"How was Alamu going to thank his friend enough for what he had done to assist him these past nine months that he'd been in trouble, burning hell, hell on earth.","Báwo ni Àlàmú yóò ṣé dúpẹ́ lọ́wọ́ ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ fún nǹkan tí ó ti ṣé láti ràn án lọ́wọ́ láti oṣù mẹ́sàn-án sẹ́yìn tí ó ti wà nínú ìṣòro, ọ̀run àpáàdì tó ń jó, ọ̀run àpáàdì lórílẹ̀ ayé."
1918,"They shook hands, together their hearts sang the silent song of happiness and gratitude to God, two people with one soul!","Wọ́n bọ ara wọn lọ́wọ́, àjọkọ ni ọkàn wọn kọrin ayọ̀ àti ìdúpẹ́ sínú láti dúpẹ́ lọ́wọ́ Ọlọ́run, ènìyàn méjì pẹ̀lú ẹ̀mí kan!"
1919,"Alamu stammered his gratitude, the whole story was long, so long he did not know where exactly to begin relating it.","Àlàmú kálòlò ìdúpẹ́ rẹ̀, gbogbo ìtàn náà gùn, tó bẹ́ẹ̀ tí kò mọ ibi tí yóò ti bẹ̀rẹ̀ rẹ̀ ní sísọ."
1920,"There will be plenty of time later',  Adio said, ‘to tell the full story, for now, let's celebrate the Victory.","Ọ̀pọ̀ àsìkò á wà tó bá yá', Àdìó sọ èyí, 'láti sọ ìtàn náà ní kíkún,  ṣùgbọ́n nísinsìnyí, jẹ́ ká a yọ ayọ̀ ìṣẹ́gun.'"
1921,"Two hours ago, Adio was sweating it out in court on behalf of his friend.","Wákàtí méjì sẹ́yìn, Àdìó ńṣe àwíjàre ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ nílé ẹjọ́."
1922,That was the third time he would argue Alamu's case.,Ìyẹn ni ìgbà kẹ́ta tí yóò ṣé àwíjàre ẹjọ́ Àlàmú.
1923,"For over one hour, he stood by Alamu as the barrage of questions came pouring in from the opponent’s lawyer, and when at last Adio started his own cross-examination of Alamu's opponent, nobody present in court was in any doubt as to where the axe would fall. The cross examination was rigorous, it was searching, it was through:","Fún wákàtí kan ó lé díẹ̀, ódúró ti Àlàmú  gírígírí bí ìbéèrèṣe dojú kọÀlàmú láti ẹnu agbẹjọ́rò alátakò rẹ̀, kò sì ẹnikẹ́ni tó wà nílé ẹjọ́ tó mọ ibi tí àáké ọ̀rọ̀ náà yóò sọlẹ̀ sí.

1924,Mr. Alamu Olaoye had been in your employment for four years?,Ọ̀gbẹ́ni Àlàmú Ọláoyè ti wàní ẹnu iṣé yín fún ọdún márùn-ún?”
1925,Yes. How many times did you issue queries to him?,Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni. Ẹ̀ẹ̀mélòó ni ẹ ti fìwé pè é lẹ́jọ́ ?
1926,There were no queries for him. What about warnings?,A kò béèrè rí. Ìkìlọ̀ ńkọ́ ?
1927,Two times. Where is the evidence?,Ẹ̀ẹ̀mejì. Ẹrí dà? 
1928,"Were they written warnings? No Verbal. Mr. Personnel Manager, did you say you set up a probe  panel?","Ṣé ẹ kọ wọ́n sílẹ̀? Rárá, àfẹnusọ ni. Ọ̀gbẹ́ni alábòójútó òṣìṣẹ́, ṣé ẹ ní ẹ dá ìgbìmọ̀ ìwádìí sílẹ̀?"

1931,Was the proceeding during the probe tape recorded?,Ṣé ẹ gba ohùn sílẹ̀ nígbà tí wọ́n ṣè pàdé ìgbìmọ̀ ìwádìí náà?
1932,"No, it was not. You merely paraphrased evidence at the probe in black and white?","Rárá, a kò gbà á. Ṣé ẹ kàn ṣé àgékúrú ìwádìí yín lásán ni?"
1933,Yes. I put it to you that Alamu's evidence at the probe was taken under duress.,Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni. Mò ń sọ pé ìwádìí yin gba ọ̀rọ̀ lẹ́nu Àlàmú tipátipá.
1934,"You stage-managed the probe Mr. Personnel Manager - secretly nosing round members of the panel, intimidating them with threats.","Ẹ kàn ṣé ìwádìí arúmọjẹ ni alákòóso òṣìṣé - tí ẹ kàn ń fimú kó pàǹtí kiri láàrin àwọn ọmọ ìgbìmọ̀ aṣèwádìí, ẹ sì ń halẹ̀ mọ́ wọn."
1935,You no longer can deny this because we have shown the court evidence to prove this.’ Lawyer Adio now turned to the learned Judge.,Ẹ ò lè sẹ́ èyí torí a ti fi gbogbo èrí tó gbe èyí lẹ́sẹ̀ hàn nílé ẹjọ́. Agbẹjọ́rò Àdìó sì kọjú sí adájọ́ tó mọṣẹ́ náà:
1936,"We must not forget, my lord, that the chairman of this kangaroo probe is the Personnel Manager's in-law who works in the Establishment.","A ògbọdọ̀ gbàgbé, olúwa à mi, pé alága ìgbìmò ìwádìí arúmọjẹ yìí tí ó ń ṣiṣẹ́ níi léeṣẹ́ yìí jẹ́ àna alákòóso òṣiṣẹ́ iléeṣẹ́ yìí."
1937,"The secretary is his cousin, the other two members are relations of the Personnel Manager’s friend.","Ìbátàn rẹ ni akọ̀wé, àwọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ́ méjì yòó kù sì jẹ́ ìbátan ọ̀rẹ́ alábòójútó òṣìṣẹ́."
1938,That was why he found it easy to stage-manage things.,Ìdí nìyí tí ó fi rọrùn fún un látiṣé awúrúju yìí.
1939,"Ever since the beginning of this case, my lord, three of the defendant's key witnesses have absconded, the other witnesses are unreliable.","Láti ìgbà tí ẹjọ́ yìí ti bẹ̀rẹ̀, Olúwa à mi, mẹ́ta nínú àwọn ẹlẹ́rìí olújẹ́jọ́ yìí ni ó ti na pápá bora, àwọn elẹ́rìí yòókù kòṣé é gbáralé."
1940,"They are the Personnel Manager’s praise singers and professional congratulations, we have seen in this court how they fell, like a pack of cards under frank and honest cross-examination.","Àwọn tó ń kọrin yin alákòóso òṣìṣẹ́ àti àwọn tó mọ ẹ̀pón àti ìkínikú-oríire ni wọ́n, a sì ti rí wọn nílé ẹjọ́yìí bí wọ́n ṣé fìdí rẹmi lábẹ́ àgbéyẹ̀wò tààrà, òdodo àti ìbéèrè ìwádìí."
1941,My client. Mr. Alamu Olaoye has been made to suffer untold hardship and embarrassment as a result of the false allegation of dereliction of duty and financial mis-management levelled against him and the consequent illegal sack letter issued by the Personnel Manager of Bajoks Company Limited'.,"Oníbàárà mi, ọ̀gbẹ́ni Àlàmú Ọláoyè ti jìyà àìmọ̀dí àti ìtìjú látàri irọ́ àìlèṣe ojúṣe-ẹni àti ìṣowó-kúmo-kùmo tí wọ́n pa mọ́ ọn, tí wọ́n sì fún un níwèé ìyọníṣẹ́ tí alábòójútó òṣìṣẹ́ iléeṣẹ́ Bajoks fún un."
1942,The Personnel Manager’s move is a calculated attempt to eliminate my client from the Establishment and slot in his own man who had just graduated in Accountancy from the university and whose letter of application and C.V. are now resting in the Personnel Manager's office.,"Ìgbésẹ̀ alábòójútó òṣìṣẹ́ wá látàrí ìṣirò ìpinnu rẹ̀ láti yọ oníbàárà mi níṣẹ́, kí wọ́n sì fi èèyàn tiwon tí óṣẹ̀ṣẹ̀ kẹ́ kọ̀ọ́ gboyè nínú ìmọ̀ ìṣirò owó ní yunifásitì, tí àwọn lẹ́tà ìwáṣẹ́ rẹ̀ àti ẹ̀rí mo-kúnjú-ìwọn rẹ̀ ń bẹ lọ́fíìsì báyìí."
1943,"Conclusively, my lord, the good name of my client has been dragged into the mud, his reputation tamished. He has been painted black in the eyes the Managing Director, the overall boss of company.","Lákòótán, Olúwa à mi, wọn ti wọ́ orúkọ rere oníbàárà mi tuurutu nínú ẹrọ̀fọ̀, wọn ti bà á lórúkọ jẹ́, wọn ti bà á jẹ́ lójú a darí alábòójútó, tí ó jẹ́ ọ̀gá iléeṣẹ́."
1944,I therefore pray the court to invoke the law to wrest my client from the vicious grip of his tormentors and oppressors.,"Fún ìdí èyí, mo rọ ilé-ẹjọ́ yìí kí wọ́n fi òfin gba oníbàárà mi lọ́wọ́ àwọn ajunilo abatẹnijẹ́ yìí."
1945,"Some fifteen minutes later, the learned Judge  started reviewing the submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant, finally pronouncing the verdict: wrongful termination of appointment of the Senior Accountant of Bajoks Company Limited, Mr. Alamu Olaoye. Action of the Personnel Manager, illegal.","Lẹ́yìn iṣéju mẹ́ẹ̀dógún, adájọ́ náà bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í ṣàtúnwò àwọn ẹ̀rí olùpẹjọ́ àti olùjẹ́jọ́, àti gbogbo àkọsílẹ̀ wọn, ìyọníṣẹ́ tó lòdì ni ti aṣírò-ọrọ̀ àgbà iléeṣẹ́ Bajoks, Ọ̀gbẹ́ni Àlàmú Ọláoyè, ìgbésẹ̀ alábòójútó òṣìṣẹ́, kò bófin mu. "
1946,The Managing Director of the company was not kept in the true picture of things. He had been deceived by his Personnel Manager.,Wọ́n kò sì fi àwòrán tòótọ́ bí ọ̀rọ̀ náà ṣe lọ han adarí alábòójútó iléeṣẹ. Alábòójú tóò ṣìṣẹ́ rẹ̀ ti tàn án.
1947,Mr. Alamu Olaoye is therefore to be re-absorbed into the company as the Senior Accountant with immediate effect.,Kí Ọ̀gbẹ́ni Àlàmú Ọláoyè padà sínú iléeṣẹ́ náà gẹ́gẹ́ bí i aṣírò-ọrọ̀ àgbà ní kíá.
1948,"His nine-month salary is to be paid in arrears with immediate effect by the company, his annual incremental credit to be approved and effected.","Owó-oṣù rẹ̀ fún oṣù mẹ́sàn-án ni iléeṣẹ́ gbọ́dọ̀ san fún un ní kíákíá, àfikún owó rẹ̀ ọdọ ọdụ́n gbọ́dọ̀ gba òǹtẹ̀, kí ó sì gbà á."
1949,A cost of five thousand naira to be paid as damages to Mr. Alamu Olaoye by the defendant.,Ẹgbẹ̀rún márùn-ún náírà ni olùjẹ́jọ́ gbọ́dọ̀ san fun Ọ̀gbẹ́ni Àlàmú Ọláoyè fún ìbàjẹ́.
1950,The attitude of the Personnel Manager is seen to be inimical to the progress and aspiration of a reputable company of Bajoks standing and the Managing Director is advised to institute a high powered inquiry into the activities of the Personnel Manager...’ That was how it all went.,"Ìhùwàsí alábòójútó òṣìṣẹ́ lè dí ìlọsíwájú àti ọjọ́ iwájú iléeṣẹ́ Bajoks lọ́wọ́, fún ìdí èyí, mo gba a darí alábòójútó níì yánju láti ṣé ìwádìí tó mún ádọ́kọ sí gbogbo iṣé alábòójútó òṣìṣẹ́ náà... Bí ó ṣe lọ rè é."
1951,"That was how Lawyer Adio fought and finally won the legal battle for his friend. And now, what was left for them was to congratulate each other; then, at leisure, recapitulate the story leading up to this final victory.","Bí agbẹjọ́rò Àdìó ṣé ja àjàṣẹ́gun ogun olófin náà fún ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀.

1952,"There will be plenty of time later', Adio  repeated, ‘to tell all the story, for now, let's celebrate... and, what a way to begin the celebration! Adio pressed a button on his tape-recorder.","Àsìkò á pọ̀ tó bá yá, Àdìó tún un sọ,”láti sọ gbogbo ìtàn  náà, ní báyìí jẹ́ kí a ṣàjọyọ̀...àti pé jẹ́ kí a bẹ̀rẹ̀ àjọyọ̀ náà báyìí!

1953,"Alamu listened... A lady's voice full of complaints and bitterness came out loud. There was another voice - that of a man, occasionally intersecting.","Àlàmú tẹ́tí... Ohùn obìnrin, tí ó kún fún ìfisùn àti ìbànújẹ́ jáde síta. Ohùn míì ǹ tún wà - ó jẹ́ ohùn ọkùnrin, tí ó ń ní igbe láàárín."
1954,"The dialogue between the two peony lasted for about five minutes, the female voice became more and more bitter and severe towards the end of the tape.","Ìtàkurọ̀sọ̀ láàárín èèyàn méjì pẹ́fún bí ìṣẹ́jú márùn-ún, ohùn obìnrin náà korò sí i, ó sì le ní òpin rẹ̀."
1955,Labake's voice was unmistakable! Alamu instantly recognised the voice of his wife! No mistake about it...it quickly dawned on him that there was a fresh case to contest.,Ohùn Làbákẹ́ òṣe é ṣì mú! Ẹṣẹ̀kẹṣẹ̀ ni Àlàmú  dá ohùn aya rẹ̀ mọ̀!

1956,"This time, a matrimonial case, Labake was going to be the complainant, he was going to be the defendant. Anxiously he waited for the time he would come face to face with Labake.","Ni àsìkò yìí, ẹjọ́ ìgbéyàwó wọn ni,  Làbákẹ́ á jẹ́ olùpẹjọ́, òun ni á jẹ́ olùjẹ́jọ́.

1957,That would be in a matter of five minutes or so from now. Adio’s car was waiting outside to take them away.,Ìyẹn á jẹ́ ọ̀rọ̀ iṣéju márùn-ún bí nǹkan sí ìsìnyí. Ọ̀kọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ Àdìó ń dúró níta láti gbé wọn lọ.
1958,It was now three o'clock in the afternoon. Everything was quiet in Alamu's house.,"Aago mẹ́ta ló lù báyìí lọ́sàn-án, gbogbo nǹkan ló dákẹ́ rọ́rọ́ ní ilé Àlàmú."
1959,"That was very unusual, the neighbours' curiosity was aroused, on other days the neighbours often listened as Alamu revved the old engine of his jalopy - disturbing their peace.","Èyí ṣàjèjì, Ọkàn ọ̀fintótó àwọn ará àdúgbò wọ́n wà lókè, ní àwọn ọjọ́ mìíràn, àwọn aládùúgbò yìí máa ń tẹ́tí sí bí Àlàmú ṣé ń ṣáná sí ẹ́ńjíìnì ọkọ̀ jalopí rẹ̀ – tí ó fi ń dà wọ́n láàmú."
1960,"They often listened to him yell out his strange outlandish laughter, and Labake blaring orders at Zenabu.","Wọ́n máa ń tẹ́tí sí bí óṣé ń rín ẹ̀rín aláruwo abàmì rẹ̀, àti bí Làbákẹ́ ṣé máa ń pariwo àṣẹ rẹ̀ fún Sènábù."
1961,Tinu would be crying somewhere inside the house. There used to be movements too; like Labake rushing out to the market; Alamu hurriedly descending the stall case. backing the car out of the garage on his seemingly endless trips out to town; Tinu toddling about on the verandah of the house; Zenabu sneaking out to play with the other girls of her age group in the nearby house.,Tinú á máa sunkún níbì kan nínú ilé.

1962,"But now, in Alamu's house, there was no noise and there was no movement, it has been like that morning - up till now - three o'clock in the afternoon.","Ṣùgbọ́n nísinsìnyí, nílé Àlàmú, kò sí ariwo kankan, kò sí ìgbésẹ̀ kankan, ó  ti rí bẹ́ẹ̀ láti àáro –títí di ìsìnyí – aago mẹ́ta lọ́sàn-án."
1963,"That was strange, where was the mad man? Where was his mad wife? Where was that little rat they called their child? And the mischievous creature called Zenabu who used to give them first-hand accounts of what went on inside this mad house?","Ìyẹn ṣàjèjì, níbo ni wèrè ọkùnrin wà?

1964,"If the neighbours had access to Alamu's house, they would have seen that Zenabu was still deep in sleep - by the side of a small load inside the sitting room of the house.","Bí àwọn aládùúgbò bá ní àǹfààní sí ilé Àlàmú, wọ́n á ti rí i pé Sènábù ṣì ń sùn lẹ́gbẹ̀ẹ́ ẹrù kékerénínú yàrá ìgbafẹ́ nínú ilé."
1965,"They would have seen that little Tinu was still in peaceful slumber in her mother's room in the house, the neighbours would have seen that Labake herself had just woken up, yawning and stretching her body after a sleepless night...","Wọn ò bá ti rí i pé Tinú kékeré sì ń sun oorun àlàáfíà nínú yàrá ìyá rẹ̀ nínú ilé, àwọn aládùúgbò ò bá rí i pe Làbákẹ́ fún rarẹ̀ ṣẹ̀ṣẹ̀ jí, ó ń yán, ó ń nara lẹ́yìn alẹ́ àìsùn..."
1966,"As the inquisitive neighbours continued gazing intently and pointing fingers, a white Mercedes-Benz zoomed in and jerked to a stop in front of Alamu’s house. Alamu came out of the car, another man following closely after him.","Bí àwọn èké àdúgbò ṣe ń wò lemọ́ lemọ́ tí wọ́n ń nàka, ni ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ mẹ̀sí ọlọ́yẹ funfun kan wọlé, tí ó sì paná níwájú ilé Àlàmú. Àlàmú jáde nínú ọkọ̀ náà, ọkùnrin mìíràn sì tẹ̀lé e pẹ́kí pẹ́kí."
1967,Together they ascended the stairs talking and nodding excitedly.,"Àwọn méjèèjì jọ gun àkàsọ̀ ilé náà, wọ́n ń sọ̀rọ̀, wọ́n sì ń kanrí mọ́lẹ̀ tì dùnnú tì dùnnú."
1968,"Inside the sitting room, Alamu and his companion met Labake and saw that Zenabu was Just waking up from sleep.","Nínú yàrá ìgbàlejo, Àlàmú àti ẹnìkejì rẹ̀ pàdé Làbákẹ́, wọ́n sì rí i pé Sènábù ṣẹ̀ṣẹ̀ ń jí láti ojú oorun ni."
1969,"The little girl scrambled up stretched and rubbed her face several times, she looked round and round - apparently to find out whether or not she was already in Kwara!","Ọmọ kékeré náà kóra jọ, ó nara, ó sì fọwọ́ pa ojú rẹ̀ láìmọye ìgbà, ó wò rá rà rá – láti mọ̀ bóyá ó ti dé Kwara tàbí kòì débẹ̀."
1970,In a minute she discovered where she was. Quickly she bent down and clutched her small load firmly in her hands:,"Ní ìṣẹ́jú kan, ó ṣàkíyèsí ibi tí ó wà. Kíá ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ mọ́lẹ̀ ó sì gbé ẹrù rẹ̀ kékeré sọ́wọ́ gírígírí:"
1971,I am ready to go now ma.’ Little Zenabu stretched out her hand in the manner of a creditor asking for money from his debtor.,"Mo ti ṣe tán láti máa lọ mà, Sènábù kékeré nawọ́ rẹ̀ bí ìgbà  ti asinwo ń bèèrè owó lọ́wọ́ Ajigbèsè rẹ̀."
1972,"Get inside your room now Zenabu!' Alamu blurted. His mind was set on a more important issue. And he had no time for a silly, raving little girl...","Wọ inú yàrá rẹ lọ báyìí Sènábù!, Àlàmú  jágbe. Ọkàn rẹ̀ wà nínú ọ̀rọ̀ tó pàtàkì ju ìyẹn lọ. Kò sì ráyè ti ọmọ oníbàjẹ́ kékeré kan...."
1973,"Get you inside quickly now! Zenabu brushed her face again and saw him for the first time, without a word of protest, she stumbled inside the pantry - her little room.","Wọlé kíá nísìnyí! Sènábù tún nu ojú rẹ̀, ó sìrí i fún ìgbà àkọ́kọ́, láìsí ọ̀rọ̀ ìyàn, ó sáré wọ inú ilé oúnjẹ – yàrá rẹ̀ kékeré."
1974,"The three people left in the sitting room now had plenty of time to gaze at one another. For a long time, they regarded one another silently, they stood like three transformed dead bodies now coming together in Hades to settle their age-long, earthly quarrel!","Àwọn enìyán mẹ́ta tí ó ṣékù sí yàrá ìgbàfe náà wá ní àsìkò láti wo ara wọn, Fún ìgbà pípẹ́, wọ́n wo ara wọn ní ìdákẹ́ rọ́rọ́, wọ́n dúró bí i òkú mẹ́ta tí a ti yí padà tí wọ́n fẹ́ parí ìjà ayé ọlọ́jọ́ pípẹ́ wọn."
1975,"Labake's gaze was confrontational and hatred-filled, she seemed to be cursing Alamu under her breath for all the sorrow and tribulations he had unleashed on her these past nine months.","Ìwò ìdojúko àti ìrira ni ó kún ojú Làbákẹ́, ó fẹ́ jọ pé ó ń ṣépè fún Àlàmú lọ́kàn rẹ̀– fún gbogbo oṣù mẹ́sàn-án yìí."
1976,"Alamu's own gaze was the apologetic, beg-your-pardon gaze. Pleadingly, his eyes surveyed Labake's angry countenance.","Ìwò ojú Àlàmú ni èyí tó ń bẹ̀bẹ̀; ìwò jọ̀wọ́-má-bínú, tẹ̀bẹ̀ tẹ̀bẹ̀, ojú rẹ̀ wo ìrísí ìbínú Làbákẹ́."
1977,Adio allowed the silent attack and defence to linger on between husband and wife without interruption for some time.,Àdìó jẹ́ kí ìjà ìdákẹ́rọ́rọ́ náà lọ láàárín tọkọtaya wọn fún ìgbà díẹ̀ láìsíì díwọ́.
1978,"Finally, he broke the silence with, Let's all sit down and talk'.","Nígbẹ̀yìn gbẹ́yín, ó fi ọ̀rọ̀ dẹ́kun ìdákẹ́rọ́rọ́ náà, Ẹ jẹ́ kí gbogbo wa jókòó, kí a sìsọ̀rọ̀."
1979,"Alamu looked at his friend with eyes twinkling like stars. When he tumed to look at the face of his wife, the tears had actually gathered, her own tears, of course, had started pouring down her cheeks.","Àlàmú wo ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ pẹ̀lú ojú títàn bí ìràwọ̀. Nìgbà tí ó yí wojú ìyàwó rẹ̀, omijé ti ṣarajọ, omijé ti ń ṣàn wálẹ̀ lẹ́rẹ̀kẹ́ rẹ̀."
1980,"Let's sit and talk,’ Adio repeated.","Ẹ jẹ́ kí a jókòó sọ̀rọ̀, Àdìó tẹnumó ọn."
1981,"Talk about what!' Labake shouted, still sobbing.","Sọ̀rọ̀ nípa kíni! Làbákẹ́ pariwo, ó ṣì ń sunkún."
1982,"Can... can... we ever sit down and talk... talk about anything on this earth again?"" She stammered.","Ṣé... ṣé... a lè tún jọ́kọ̀ó sọ̀rọ̀ nípa nǹkankan mọ́ láé?, Ó kálòlò."
1983,"We'll sit and talk... We just must sit down and talk,’ Adio pleaded, 'talk things over.’","A máa jókòó sọ̀rọ̀... a ní láti jókòo, kí a sọ̀rọ̀”, Àdìó bẹ̀bẹ̀, Kí a sọ ọ́ parí”."
1984,"I have to explain, Alamu submitted in a voice that seemed to come  from another person.","Mo ní láti ṣàlàyé, Àlàmú sọ̀rọ̀ pẹ̀lú ohùn tí ó jọ pé ó tẹnu ẹlòmíràn jáde."
1985,"There was prolonged silence again. Alamu tried to get himself together, Labake wiped her own face with a handkerchief and blew her nose.","Ìdákẹ́rọ́rọ́ tí ó pẹ́ tún wáyé. Àlàmú gbìyànjú láti ṣarajo, Làbákẹ́ nu ojú tirẹ̀ pẹ̀lú aṣọ ìnujú, ó sì fun imú rẹ̀."
1986,"Then she took another look at her husband. Labake bent her head. That strange 'ha ha ha ha’ laughter came to her ears once more, she heard the mocking voices of the neighbours once more, she saw, anew, how the mammy-wagon driver demonstrated the turning of the head.","Lẹ́yìn náà ni ó tún wo ọkọ ṛẹ̀. Làbákẹ́ doríkodò.  Ẹ̀rín “ha ha ha ha” abàmì yẹn tún wá sí etí rẹ̀, ó gbọ́ ohùn ìfiniṣeyẹ̀yẹ́ àwọn aládùúgbò lẹ́ẹ̀kan sí i, ó tún rí awakọ̀ ọkọ̀ akẹ́rù tí ó ń ṣàpèjúwe bí orí ṣe yí tó."
1987,"Then, she moaned, and fresh tears gathered, those items which you carried away from home Alamu... What happened?","Lẹ́yìn náà, ó gbin, omijé tuntun tún ṣarajọ, àwọn ohunèèlò tí o kó kúrò nílé Àlàmú... Kí ló ṣẹlẹ̀ ?”"
1988,"I sold them Labake, so that we would not starve, I sold them to make ends meet... Adio discovered he had to be blunt and tell the truth, that was the only way to restore Labake's confidence which had been badly shaken.","Mo tà wọ́n Làbákẹ́, kébi má ba à pa wá, mo tà wọ́n láti lè jẹ́ ká a rọ́wọ́ mú lọ ṣénu....”. Ó ṣàkíyèsí pé òun ní láti díjú, kí ó sọ òtítọ́,  ọ́nà yìí ni ó lè gbà láti dá ìfọkàn tán Làbákẹ́ nínú rẹ̀ padà."
1989,"What about your car, Alamu? I sold that one out too Labake... Adio was kind enough to let me have his old Volkswagen.","Ọkọ̀ rẹ ńkọ́, Àlàmú? Mo ta ìyẹn náà Làbákẹ́... Àdìó sìṣé dáadáa láti lè jẹ́ kí n lo ọkọ̀ bítù àlòkù rẹ̀ ."
1990,"In a twinkle of an eye the picture of the Chairman of the Driver's Unon came to Labake's mind - a huge-framed, pot bellied individual, smiling and waving cheerfully to the mammy- wagon driver.","Ní ìṣẹ́ju àáyá kan, àwòrán alága àwọn ẹgbẹ́ awakọ̀ wá sí ọkàn Làbákẹ́ – ó lára, ó níkùn agbè, ó ń rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́, ó sì ń juwọ́ tayọ̀ tayọ̀ sí awakọ̀ ọkọ̀-akẹ́rù náà."
1991,"Labake saw, again, the jumbled mass of second-hand articles at the motor park mini-market.",Làbákẹ́ tún rí àwọn nǹkan àlòkù tí wọ́n ń tà ní ọjà kékeré ní ibùdókọ̀.
1992,"She heard, once more, the voice of the traders calling her, inviting her to come and purchase second-hand articles.","Ó tún gbọ́ lẹ́ẹ̀kan sí i, ohùn àwọn tí ó ń pè é pé kí ó wá ra nǹkan àlòkù."
1993,"Alamu... Alamu...' Labake continued, ‘What happened to your job?","Àlàmú... Àlàmú…' Làbákẹ́ tesíwájú, 'Kí ló ṣẹlẹ̀ sí iṣẹ́ rẹ?'"
1994,I Lost it Labake. Labake nearly collapsed at all these revelations.,Mo pàdánù rẹ̀ Làbákẹ́. Làbákẹ́ ti fẹ́rẹ̀ ẹ́ dákú pẹ̀lú gbogbo ìfihàn yìí.
1995,"She knew nothing about them, she didn't know Alamu had been contesting his termination of appointment in court.","Kò mọ nǹkankan nípa wọn, kò mọ̀ pé Àlàmú ti ń du ẹjọ́ ìyọníṣẹ́ rẹ̀ nílé ẹj̣́o."
1996,She did not know Adio was his lawyer. She did not know Alamu had won the case.,Kò sì mọ̀ pé Àdìó ni agbẹjọ́rò rẹ̀. Kò mọ̀ pé Àlàmú ti jáwé olúborí ẹjọ́ náà.
1997,Alamu was just relating all these to her now. Her jaw dropped in disbelief.,Àlàmú ṣẹ̀ṣẹ̀ ń sọ gbogbo èyí fún un báyìí. Ẹnu yà á láìgbàgbọ́.
1998,And you were smoking and drinking too Alamu.,"O sì ń fa sìgá, ò ń mu ọtí náà Àlàmú."
1999,"Yes, Labake to keep the sorrow away.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni,  Làbákẹ́ láti fi lé ìbànújẹ́ kúrò."
2000,You never told me anything Alamu.,O ò sọ nǹkankan fún  mi rí Àlàmú.
2001,"I thought it would break your heart, Labake.","Mo lẹ̀rọ pé á bà ọ́ lọkàn jẹ́ ni,  Làbákẹ́"
2002,Each answer from Alamu cut through Labake's heart like a dagger.,Gbogbo ìdáhùn tí ó wá láti ẹnu Àlàmú la ọkàn Làbákẹ́ kọjá bí i idà.
2003,That Alamu had kept so much away for so long filled all her veins with pain.,Pé Àlàmú kó gbogbo nǹkan tó pọ̀ báyìí pamọ́ fi ẹ̀dùn sínú iṣan ṛẹ̀.
2004,"Finally, you broke my heart Alamu... And all through, your mother was at my throat. Mama?","Nígbẹ̀yìn gbẹ́yín, O bà mí lọ́kàn jẹ́ Àlàmú... Nínú gbogbo rẹ̀, ìyá rẹ dúró lé mi lọ́rùn, Màmá?"
2005,"Yes, Labake related all she had suffered in the hands of Mama, the sense of guilt descended heavily on Alamu and he started mumbling unreserved apology.","Bẹ́ẹ̀ ni, Làbákẹ́ sọ gbogbo ìyà tí ó jẹ lọ́wọ́ Màmá, ẹmí ìdára-ẹni-lẹ́bi bà lé Àlàmú, ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í tọrọ àforíjì."
2006,"There was a knock on the door, the knock was persistent. None of them was prepared for the visitor who knocked and eventually came into the room without waiting for an answer.","Ilẹ̀kùn kàn, kíkàn náà jẹ́ lemọ́lemọ́. Kò sí nǹkankan nínú wọn tí ó ti gbáradì fún  àlejò tí ó ń kán ilẹ̀kùn, tí ó sì jàjà wọ inú ilé láìdúró de èsì."
2007,Mama! She came into the room - followed closely by Esuniyi.,Màmá! Ó wọ inú ilé – tí Èṣùníyì sì tẹ̀lé e.
2008,"Esuniyi hesitated for some seconds at the door, then looked round, and started whispering to himself.","Èṣùníyì dúró fún ìṣẹ́ju àáyá díẹ̀ lẹ́nu ọ̀nà, lẹ́yìn náà, ó wò yíká, ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si ísọ̀rọ̀ kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́ sí ara rẹ̀."
2009,"He pointed his forefingers, three times, to Alamu and touched his own chest three times too.","Ó na ìka ìlábẹ̀ rẹ̀ lẹ́ẹ̀mẹ́ta sí Àlàmú, ó sì fọwọ́ kan àyà tirẹ̀ lẹ́ẹ̀mẹ́ta náà."
2010,"He bent down, looked Alamu in the face, and started backing out of the room, still mumbling, still whispering.","Ó bẹ̀rẹ̀ mọ́lẹ̀, ó wo ojú Àlàmú, ó sì bẹ̀rẹ̀ si í fẹ̀yìn rìn jáde nínú ilé, ó sì ń sọ̀rọ̀ wụ́yẹ́wụ́yẹ́."
2011,"The spell had been cast. Mama smiled, it was a swift operation, just like it had been planned.","Ogun ti ṣé, màmá rẹ́rìn-ín músẹ́,  iṣé tí ó yá ni, gẹ́gẹ́ bí wọ́n ti ṣé gbẹ̀rò rẹ̀ nìyẹn."
2012,"It did not last more than three minutes. And before anybody had the time to say a word, Esuniyi was already downstairs, trudging away along the street.","Kò ju iṣéju mẹ́ta lọ, kí ẹnikẹ́ni tó ní àǹfààní láti sọ̀rọ̀ kan, Èṣùníyì ti wà ní ìsàlẹ̀, ó ń já lọ ní òpópónà."
2013,Labake moved nearer Alamu and whispered to his ears: Your mother's medicine man.,"Làbákẹ́ súnmọ́ Àlàmú, ó sì sọ ọ́ sí i léti kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́; Bàbá oniṣègùn ìyá rẹ."
2014,Brought from the village to cure your malady.,"Tí wọ́n mú wá láti abúlé, láti wo aágànná rẹ sàn."
2015,"She moved up to Adio again and whispered: Mama's medicine man, brought to cure your friend's malady.","Ó tún sún mọ́ Àdìó, ó sọ̀rọ̀ kẹ́lẹ́kẹ́lẹ́: Bàbá oníṣègùn Màmá tí wọ́n mú wá láti wo aágànná ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ sàn."
2016,The three people exchanged quick glances and smiled. Who was mad really? None but this man in apete dress.,"Àwọn èèyàn mẹ́tẹ̀ẹ̀ta pààrọ̀ ìwò fìrí, wọ́n sì rẹ́rìn-ínmúsẹ́.

2017,A mad man coming in to cure somebody they said is mad. Well... Everybody must be mad then! The whole world must have gone mad!,"Wèrè tí ó ń bọ̀ wá wo ẹni tí wọ́n sọ pé ó ya wèrè. Ẹẹnnnn, gbogbo èèyàn ló ya wèrè nìyẹn! Gbogbo àgbáyé ló ti ya wèrè nìyẹn!"
