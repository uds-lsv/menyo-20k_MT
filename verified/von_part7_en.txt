Arike Ogunbowale was on Sunday night the star as she propelled Notre Dame to deliver the 2018 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball title with a 61-58 victory over Mississippi State.

To do that twice in one weekend, the biggest stage in college basketball, it’s crazy,” Ogunbowale said. Ogunbowale, who scored 27 points in Friday’s epic semi-final win over the Huskies, earned most outstanding player honours for the tournament. 
I practise this all the time. It’s everyone’s dream to get a game-winning shot. So, you practise this in the gym when you’re by yourself. So, I was prepared for this moment.”

He is one of the greatest exports of Nigerian football.

--- Morocco should host 2026 World Cup – Blatter
Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter has put his support behind Morocco’s bid to host the 2026 World Cup finals, saying the North African country would be the logical choice. 
Morocco is bidding for the fifth time to host the World Cup finals, having also tried for the 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010 tournaments. 
The only other bid is a joint one from the U.S., Canada and Mexico with football’s world governing body FIFA due to choose the hosts at its Congress in Moscow in June. 
“World Cup 2026: Co-hosting rejected by FIFA after 2002 (also applied in 2010 and 2018). 
And now: Morocco would be the logical host! And it is time for Africa again!” 
Blatter, who was FIFA president from 1998 to 2015, turned against co-hosting after the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, the only time the tournament has been shared. 
The eighty-one-year-old Swiss quit his post and was later banned for six years for ethics violations by FIFA’s ethics committee. 
The only tournament staged in Africa so far was the 2010 finals in South Africa, something Blatter is immensely proud of.
